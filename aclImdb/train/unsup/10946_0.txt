OK, maybe I'm giving in to nostalgia here but I rented "Footloose" recently and thought it was great. Yes, it's definitely a teen flick, similar to "Dirty Dancing", and aging a little now.But the music is great and the plot and themes do as much for me as "Grease" ever did. As teen movies go, it is somewhat original and interesting.Who should see this film:-- Teens with nothing better to do on a rainy day-- People reliving the 1980s, you won't be disappointed tosee this one againI'll give Footloose a 9 out of 10 because it cheered me up on a day I needed it.
