This episode is my favourite because it best demonstrates the potential the show had to offer.I remember watching the pilot and anxious for the following week when the following episode was on.John Rhys-Davies was one of the original reasons for me watching the show because I saw him in "James Bond 007" "The Living Daylights" and "Indiana Jones".I think it is one of the best pilots I have seen for a show.The pilot gives reasonable insight into the characters of the show before they set off "sliding" into parallel worlds.
