A low budget, badly acted film............ everything about this film is poorly staged, wooden acting by C list actors and unbelievable settings, I'm still watching this as I write........... OMG so awful.What more can I say, the scenes do not fit together....The 'escape' scenes well, simply not believable.Best line ... He's dead (immediately pull sheet over head LOL)I'm still cringing as I write this, if second graders presented this as a home movie I would expect better acting (and sets :) )Please, let me write this comment without having to make up ten lines about a film that doesn't even deserve one!!!!!Even if you are desperate to watch a film, don't bother with this - paint a wall and watch it dry or sit in the garden and watch grass grow, so much more entertaining :))
