You've got Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck and Alexis Smith in a film and yet it stinks. Where did this film go wrong?Bogart stars as a crazed killer who has already murdered his first unseen wife and is well on his way to do in wife #2 played by Barbara Stanwyck. In a way, I thought Miss Stanwyck was using this film as a dress rehearsal for her Oscar nominated performance in the following year for "Sorry, Wrong Number."Ann Carter stars as Bea, Bogart's daughter from his first marriage. The child is precocious. She sounds like a 40 year old rather than a child of 8 or 9 which she is supposed to be.Nigel Bruce is somewhat effective as the doctor to Stanwyck who loves his "occasional" drink and obsessive talking about the burglar-strangler on the loose.The heavy rain and dark atmosphere adds to eeriness of the production. Problem is that the plot can be figured out in about 10 minutes.
