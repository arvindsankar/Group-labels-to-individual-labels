I was very impressed with the overall cleanliness of this film. Definitely something that the whole family can enjoy and nothing that a parent would have to cover anyone's eyes.This is an example of good Christian film making that will show that Christians can make a quality film.Their world view definitely comes out in this film. That view is hope!Keep up the good work.The film is up there in quality with Return of the Titans. It's a story about redemption, faith, forgiveness, love and team!Again, keep up the good work.Executive produced by one of the authors of the Left Behind Series.
