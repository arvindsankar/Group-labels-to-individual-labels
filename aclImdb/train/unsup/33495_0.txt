That's not to say there's not something of worth in it, but someone hereclaims that Mamet wrote this- the truth is, he SOLD it, and it became'Hollywoodized', sanitized and beaten down from it's pure and shockingform. On stage this was a howl, a rage against the inevitable- fallingin love. On film, it's a little gooey and sweet, not much bite there,but a few interesting lines (usually all taken from Mamets play) thathit home about the difficulty of sacrificing 'self' to become a'couple'. Lowe and Moore are pretty, but it's the surroundingcharacters that actually act and are interesting, and if you look hardyou can see some good actors in small roles, such as Megan Mullaly (Willand Grace) Catherine Keener (Walking and Talking) and Ray Wohl(Arli$$). This is definitely a film of and for it's time, although notquite as painfully dated as St. Elmos Fire, you'll still laugh at someof the hair styles and fashions and music. The director went on tocreate "thirtysomething", which tells you right there that he didn'thave much in common with David Mamet. A curiosity, this film. .
