When it first came out in '88, I read in the newspaper that it was not well received.Years later I watched it again and I now thing it's one of the best comedies out.Randy Quaid and Richard Prior made pure humour.It would have been great to see them both in something much more intense.Each great in their own way, as a team they would be double the trouble and 5 times the fun.Far better than any Adam Sandler or Seth Rogan movie made and better than the Sandler/Rogan actors themselves.Nothing enormously award winning, but a pleasurable waste of time.
