I remember when I first saw this movie. I was laughing so hard, I nearly cried! I really love the scene where the Union spies drop the wood down at him and when he looked up. One of the spies pointed out that: "There's only one man in that engine!" HOW STUPID THEY WERE! I thought it was amazing how he did all of those stunts! Because they did not have the technology back then to edit it like it was something else.The scene were the train fell into the river after the bridge collapsed, was perhaps the most expensive and difficult part of the movie to film. And if you noticed the looks on the faces of the Union officers when the camera cut to them, those were for real, because they were not told what was going to happen to that train! So Bravo Buster Keaton! 10/10
