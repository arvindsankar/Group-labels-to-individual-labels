This is a very bad showYou have to have the intelligence of Forrest Gump to believe in this bull"BEEP".None of what is claimed in this "film" is a fact - it is all fiction.It is simply lies upon lies.But there also should be films for the humans on the leftwing - they prefer their fantasy world, where facts and evidence does not have any value. The leftwing have never understood that you have to do bad things to, in the end, do well. But then again: the leftwing have killed more people than the rightwing - The rightwing exist of Hitler (killed 10 million Jews, Gipsies, homosexuals and communist), Mussolini (probably killed 2 million, Ethiopians, Greek people and political adversaries), Franco (1 - 2 million communists, socialist and other) and Pinochet (1 million of all sorts). So the rightwing killed about 15 million people. Then let us look at the leftwing: Stalin (killed about at least 20 million), Lenin (killed 4 million +), Mao (killed about 20 million also), Pol Pot (killed 4 out of Cambodia's population of 8 million) and Saddam Hussein (killed 4 million Iranians plus 1 million Kurds and political opponents)..... So the leftwing have killed about 53 million people. Wing = people killed.Rightwing = 15 million. Leftwing = 53 million.Who has most blood on their hands??.The leftwing always tries to hide its bloody face behind anti-war/anti-American probanganda - but when they are at power, they become the most hateful and cold killers, though the hide behind that they are doing it to people who have the wrong opinion.But as i said: very bad show. It is poorly made. 1 out of 10 - it is simply just awful.
