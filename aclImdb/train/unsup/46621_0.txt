This well known movie could produce a p*nese overdose. The main concept is fair but somehow distorted with bad taste. Anyway some scenes will fit perfectly in any film anthology.The plot is simplistic, the porn is too raw, and the parody is weak. The ridiculous subreal ambient created is the most hilarious thing in the movie.The movie is creative in some ways, indeed, and has an artisctical and conceptual value, but the average is mediocre for me.If yo are looking for something sexy, do not look this movie (I wonder if sexiness could be found in any porn movie).
