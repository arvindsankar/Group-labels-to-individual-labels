I thought that the movie was dramatic with heart touching scenes.I would like to see a sequel to this movie.The ending does leave one to wonder what will happen to the Invisible People.Also a story line could be built on the idea that Tomme is now the Chief.A future sequel could show us how the tribe has thrived under the leadership of Tomme.This sequel could also show us Tomme and Kachiri and their family.I would like to see Tomme teaching his children about the traditions that were passed down to him from his adopted father Wanadi.
