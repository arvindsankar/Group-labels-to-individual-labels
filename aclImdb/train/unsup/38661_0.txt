This movie is one of the worst of the genere, the only actor with a hint of talent is Evan Lurie (David).The story centers around two rivals a cop, and a playboy. They are both in love with the same woman, and neither of them knows if her daughter is their child. And when the child is kidnapped they put their differences aside and join forces in the search for the kidnappers.On the whole a bad movie with, but with some good fighting scenes.I give it 2/10
