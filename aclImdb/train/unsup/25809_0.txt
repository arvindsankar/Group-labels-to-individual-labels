This movie is bad in every respect. The direction is bush-league, after-school-special quality. The acting is bad. Mare Winningham sleeps through this dog, as I did. Anthony Edwards did an OK job of acting, but he seems to be as disinterested as I was in this movie.The special effects are third rate. The plot idea isn't as developed as it could be.Anthony Edwards needs to rush to the "ER" and have this movie surgically removed from his resume.
