SPOILERS AHEAD: I remember seeing this one when it came outin theaters and being alternately amused and aggravated by itshokey, convoluted plot, which seems to borrow themes fromseveral good sources dealing with black magic, the supernatural,and even Agatha Christie (as there is a "Ten Little Indians" typedevice in which the guests are mysteriously knocked-off one byone). Unfortunately, it's not cobbled together very well. A couple ofthe deaths are genuinely disturbing (imagine surfacing in a poolto find yourself trapped underwater) but suffer from the luridsupernatural yarn that underlies the proceedings. Some nicevisual touches, and attractive British country locations buoy thisone up a bit, but not before the whole thing sinks under its ownconfused weight by the last reel. One noteworthy silver lining tothis dark cloud is provided by Sam Elliot who, in a rather cheekyturn, saunters through a bathroom in his birthday suit (with, it mustbe said, absolutely nothing to be ashamed of!). This film certainlyhad potential, if it lacked focus. Katharine Ross and Sam Elliotplay likable enough, down-to-earth inheritors who (through sheerstupidity) wind up stuck in this mire with a bunch of continentalkooks, played by the ever decadent Charles Gray, velvet-voicedHildegarde Neil, and other talents like Margaret Tyzack, LeeMontague, and (an oddly placed) Roger Daltrey. Not a shabby setof actors to be sure, but they're working with a ridiculous script.See Ross in "The Stepford Wives" and Elliot in "Lifeguard" (bettervehicles from this era). Charles Gray, many will recall from the nowclassic "Rocky Horror Picture Show". "The Legacy" is notnecessarily to be completely avoided (unless you are faced withwatching the heavily edited TV print -- the one with the inexplicablyexpanded title, "The Legacy of Maggie Walsh"), but it's not at all tobe taken seriously either. Much as it wants to be.
