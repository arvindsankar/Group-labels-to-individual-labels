4 women in a holding cell, creepy doctors, and a man with a large kitchen utensil carving away in the nightly hours... and a - drum roll- twist in the end.The above got me sold on it, however when watching it a couple of other problems were quickly visible.Uninteresting actors with bad lines, no budget - the holding cell looks like a part of a construction yard with plastic- way way way too long and the twist is not that bad but played out way too long.. I see a recurrence here, but anyway.Tighter editing - the film can cut away at least 30 minutes- better actors and a better story would have done miracles. If you watch it now keep the remote handy to fast forward and check if you still give a damn about the twist in the end, I know I didn't.Don't waste your time.
