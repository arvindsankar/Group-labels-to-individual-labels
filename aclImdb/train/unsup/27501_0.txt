There were two films of this genre: The Rose & A Star is Born. The Divine Ms. M turns in a performance that tops KrisKristofferson & Barbara Streisand - with ease (using one of Kristofferson's songs & a drag-queen Streisand impersonator!). This film is a novelty / mockumentary take on a Janis Joplin type. Obviously, Ms. Middler would have made a documentary if she hadwanted. . .so this is Bette jumping off where she feels she cangive an over-the-top performance.There are no bad parts to this film. There are no bad songs. Thewhole film has high production values and is comparable to TheLast Waltz in the intensity of the performance.My favorite song is "Fire Down Below" - a dynamite performance. Somehow the performance was left off of the soundtrack albumand the only decent cover is Bob Seger's.If you want to see Bette acting and singing at a level few can hopeto equal: watch the film.
