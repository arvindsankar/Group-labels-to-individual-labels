If there's anything worse than the teen flick, there's the aging teen flick.I caught this in the 1980s on cable TV and it's representative of the Meatballs and Porky's generation of films.What this film has in common with Star Wars and the X-Men is the fantasy of magical powers.Even if some nudity will amuse you, there's not much about Zapped! worth seeing.Who should see this film:-- nobodyI'll give Zapped! a 3 out of 10.
