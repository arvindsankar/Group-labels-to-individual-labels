I completely understand the plot it goes like this :- Girl without memory has face changed for some reason - The police changed her memory - She changed her face because she did a drug rip-deal - Here brother likes to kill people who look like her - Actually she is a Turkish terrorist - Jean reno is involved in something - The turks kill another group of turks in a bath filled with mintThen it gets better :- The girl is a ninja - The drugs are in an enormous cave filled with death people - The case collapses and Reno is death - No he is not deathNever mind all that the end is amazing :- Reno, the cop, the girl, the brother all end up in Turkey - At the same time of course, the whole France police force is also there - The girl kills here father - The cop, reno and the police kill everyone else in the village - The serial killer brother tries to serial kill the girlThe best thing about this movie however is the final end :- Switch of DVD player, throw disk in bin, and sue the french for wasting your time.Movie seem to be made by a bunch of spaced out french with a high budget. Awful just awful, worst waste of time and money ever (well, there's french cars which are a step below that...)
