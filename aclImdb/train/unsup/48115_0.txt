GODAWFUL! Not sure how they though any part of this would be scary e.g. the God of Death intro.The Anime was alright and I heard that this was even better. I have since removed such so called creditable witnesses to movies from my friends list.Don't ever ever ever ever see this movie, unless being disappointed is what you're looking for.I don't get how so many people thought this was a masterpiece. I mean everything was bad about it special effects, acting, dubbing, and there were many goofs that are unthinkable.
