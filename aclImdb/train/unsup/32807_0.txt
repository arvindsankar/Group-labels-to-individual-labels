Intimate KISSES and that's about it!This movie is a TOTAL waste of time. The first 20 to 30 minutes is bearable then this movie is LIKE a DRAG! I totally disliked this movie.BORING and DULL. Stupid.Broken English has nothing to do with the movie. OK so what happened because he had Broken English? Nothing!The performances are OK! I don't want to Talk about it since I hated the film.The story isn't anything new. It's the same old GIRL not finding her Perfect GUY QUEST.I wish thay would rather have put some CLICHÃ‰' Stuff. I think the movie would be MORE ENJOYABLE then.Otherwise it's a TOTAL mess- Low Budget film. 2/10
