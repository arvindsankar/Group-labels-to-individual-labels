If Jennifer Garner is a good actress, you can't tell from the creative mess that is Alias.No matter what improbable and plot hole-ridden situation the bad writers put her character into, there is one thing you can be sure of: she will be wearing improbably skimpy clothes and/or she will be pouting and otherwise mugging for the camera.All pretense at actual drama in Alias died in the first half-hour of the pilot, and all that was left was a fashion show masquerading as a spy thriller.Hopefully, Jennifer Garner will get some good directors in the future who will strip her of her bad habits.As to J.J. Abrams, his writing is so abysmal, I do not hold any hope for improvement. All I can do is avoid any further show or movie he has anything to do with.
