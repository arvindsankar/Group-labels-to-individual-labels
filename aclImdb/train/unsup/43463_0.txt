I liked the first HellBoy & Guillermo del Toro was too good in Pan's Labyrinth! Which were the reasons for going to the movie with high expectations! Maybe that was the mistake,which left me hugely disappointed. Good: CGI,few heartfelt moments of romanceBad: All the characterizations were week,Especially Jeffrey Tambor's(Tom Manning).Tom is always pleasant to HellBoy and is always requesting HellBoy to simmer down, but is always being picked on by Hellboy.Tom Manning doesn't seem ever to be in control so I don't see why Hellboy should be so irritated with him!In the end even Johann Krauss gets angry with him!Maybe they thought that its the most easy way to add slapstick humor!The initial hype for the Forest God was too much for it to simply be killed by gunshots to the head,whereas all it was able to do was grow and swing its arms!Prince Nuada's reason for returning from exile to wage war on the human after several centuries is week, there seems to be no strong reason for him to begin the war again!When Hellboy is fatally wounded,the Prince has the chance to just collect the piece of the crown and have his Golden army but he just leaves asking them to bring the piece!The team agrees to go after the Prince to save HellBoy, which he is by his father , the Angel of Death(which seems to be just to add a plot for any future Hellboy movies).But even after he is saved they just want to give us more action, so they go after the Prince!Princess Nuala seems to be always against the war but in the end when Prince Nuada stakes his claim to the Golden Army as the unchallenged heir she is silent as if it was to give an opportunity for the CGI team to show off with a fight sequence!Verdict: Guillermo del Toro seems to be stuck at Pan's Labyrinth , Hellboy2 seems like just a bad Pan's Labyrinth hangover!But if you like to watch meaningless impressive CGI action, Hellboy2 is not a bad choice for a pretty boring day. Otherwise it just leaves you disappointed.why i have rated it 1/10 , is because it is disappointing to watch a good director like Guillermo del Toro completely miss the target.
