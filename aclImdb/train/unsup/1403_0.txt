I've watched it 15 times in a row on an old VHS commercialrelease that includes The Raven... what a wonderful pair!Some comments seem to find it a plot hole when Lugosi kills ahouse pet and no one is alarmed -indeed, not somethingcommon in the world as we know it. My view is that the Black Cat is Karloff, whom Lugosi goes there tokill slowly... does he not? Also, in a few moments we see that Karloff has the same black catin hand, very much alive, and he mentions the cat has nine lives. Other words are said about the two men having in effect alreadydied years ago... look beneath the surface of this movie... don'ttake it literally, and much richness is there... the art deco, Bauhausarchitecture... the wondrous infusion of Beethoven's 7th after the2nd appearance of the Black Cat. I could watch this movie a hundred more times and not tire of it.
