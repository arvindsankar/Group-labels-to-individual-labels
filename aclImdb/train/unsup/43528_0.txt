Jeff Ltd is a pathetic show on every level.It's a comedy that isn't funny first of all. The acting is terrible, the scripts/stories are terrible, the directing and producing in fact the production as a whole is terrible.None of the characters are likable and that is okay because you can have a comedy show with unlikeable people but the characters aren't funny either. The acting is the big downfall with this show.I hope it gets taken off the airwaves soon because Jeff Lts is pathetically bad.1/10
