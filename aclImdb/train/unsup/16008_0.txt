Oh sure, I could review a film that some of you have seen, but where's the fun in that?In Martin Scorsese's After Hours, you will find a dark ride into the fashionable Soho district of New York City of the mid-eighties that leads Paul Hackett into enemy territory.Once this average word-processing, white, single male realizes he's in over his head, he just wants to go home. Simple enough. But it's not that easy for him.He tells little lies that get him deeper and deeper into trouble until he's literally running for his life from the crazed denizens of the night, to whom "After Hours" do not apply.This film is a personal favourite of mine, but I really don't blame anyone for not liking it. It is a little weird, and that's why I probably enjoy it. I do believe this film has truly achieved what is known as "cult" status. Although I've never been fond of the term, I can't say I've met many people who've seen this film without my recommending it to them. But I've heard that it is something of a critical success.It is also very darkly funny.My wife doesn't like this film, she hates the main character and she finds his actions to be at times, stupid and irrational. She may have a point, but she's not appreciating the film from an angle of sheer desperation, which causes people to act in such a manner, which is what I feel the film is all about. That and that blondes are essentially trouble, no offence to my dear siblings.See it and decide for yourself. Worth hunting for. K.
