At First it was BORING but I started to like it as they got more more into the mystery of the tape.It did need little bit more but it was GREAT! They Need more people and needed to MAke more and more of the tapes till it goes international and Racheal and Aiden has to stop it before everyone sees it. I would say go see it if you like mystery that is not that Gory,Bloody Has lots of language, and Not that Scary. either see it by yourself or with a friend.But it Was Great!
