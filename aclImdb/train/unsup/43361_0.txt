I went into this movie hardly knowing anything about the story. I should have done more research. I suppose it's a laudable effort, but it falls flat completely, in my opinion. The budding romance between the old prof (Kingsley) and the young hot Cruz is just okay. She's obviously a sexy woman, but seeing her in that situation with the professor made her seem less appealing, not more. Another thing that really bothered me about this movie was the pretentious classical music that was throughout. It became unbearable after a while, I must say.Negatives: Trite story acted out with no passion or innovation. Positives: Cruz is beautiful and intriguing but that's not enough to make this even mildly entertaining.
