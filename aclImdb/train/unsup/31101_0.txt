Sorry all, but even though I overall LOVED the movie the author MISSED on the history. The "Famous Face on the Barroom Floor" was not painted on the floor of the Teller House of Central City Colorado until 1936. Movie stated that competing at the shooting contest was Billy Dixon who died in 1913. How could Billy have possibly been at the contest after he was dead?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Face_on_the_Barroom_Floor_(painting)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Dixon8 out of 10 for the overall feel of the movie, 2 out of 10 for the history inaccuracy.A simple average of the above scores would lead to a 50% or 5 of a possible 10. A simple average, though does not explain the high level of overall enjoyment from the work of fiction. The wife properly explained it as a historical romance novel which misses on some accounts.Watch it and enjoy it, but first turn off a portion of your mind.
