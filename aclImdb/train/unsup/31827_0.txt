Subhash Ghai always shows NRIs in bad light and Indians as too goodHis carricatured NRIs in PARDES, TAAL are e.g.s of thoseThe film is just that, The NRIs are shown as bad, while our Indians are shown as pure Ganga typeThe film is typical, there are some good situations but the story isn't different nor is the treatment In fact surprisingly SRK played the role of getting a girl for someone else a lot in 1997, be it KOYLA, PARDES Direction by Subhash Ghai is ordinary Music is goodIn this film SRK is a pleasure, here he doesn't ham thankfully as he always does Here he is well directed and gives a restrained performance Mahima is decent, she looks gorgeous but sadly her career didn't' go ahead Apoorva is too awkward Amongst rest Amrish Puri excels as usual Alok Nath is stereotypical rest are okay
