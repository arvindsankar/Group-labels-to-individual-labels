In 1975 I was still in the army.We'd been through "Mod Squad" and similar 'groovy' attempts at television showing us that it was awkward to be a Vietnam vet - because ALL of them were either cops or robbers. What the medium at the time was NOT showing, was that things hadn't changed since the First World War: when the troops come home, they are not the same people they were when they went away.OK. That's something best discussed on another day.SWAT is crap because the actors make the notion of watching paint dry exciting. It might be an early Spelling production, but it's as terrible as the 'seventies Hannah Barbera cartoons. 'Wooden' is an insult to trees.There is NO attempt to be 'real' or even occasionally-accurate when it comes to weapons per se and why people steal/use them.Occasional 'through-the-scope' sniper views make me want to weep. Trust me, you don't want to know.Stories/scenarios are as hackneyed as the characters. Let's face it: pneumonic plague (?!) is not got rid of as easy as "We've been inoculated, therefore you're safe". That particular episode with 'Little Billy' surviving is, indeed, a classic.Did I offer 2/10? I must be dreaming...
