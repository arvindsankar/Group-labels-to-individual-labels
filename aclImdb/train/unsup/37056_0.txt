I hardly know where to start. I was expecting things to be cut-out to make the book fit in a movie but not changed to such a degree that it almost seems like a different story.The whole movie seemed to be such a hurry that it felt like it was just a stumbling rush towards the end. Some of the characters did a decent enough job honouring their counterparts in the book; Meggie, Elinor, TeResa, Dustfinger, Magpie to mention a few.On the other hand Basta didn't even get close to portraying the evil, knife-wielding murderer. Flatnose just made me laugh, he was just big-nosed buffoon. He just needed to paint the nose red. I mean they are supposed to inspire fear and be purely evil.The ending? They actually managed to tie up all the loose ends, WHICH THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO!!! THERE IS A PART TWO AND PART THREE FOR GOD'S SAKE!CONCLUSION: Read the book instead! So much more enjoyable! Seems like just another movie trying to make money instead of entertaining the audience.
