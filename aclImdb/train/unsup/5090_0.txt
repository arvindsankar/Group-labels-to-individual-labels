What? BL not a lesbian? Be real folks, even in my high school in SoCal in the very early 70s, we'd have wondered. And, it turns out, the people we wondered about? Turns out that at reunions they brought same sex spouses. Already, in this movie, this is a cultural "poke in our eye" to re-examine our ideas.Still, the movie is very fun. Very interesting, well written, and very well photographed. Malibu! Well, hell, yeah! Even better than the beaches in Orange County.For those who haven't seen the original movie (which this is), give it a shot. It holds up very, very well.
