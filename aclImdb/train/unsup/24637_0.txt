I would be nice if the people who control the rights to the show, . remaster them and release all 97 episodes to DVD. . I found 95 of the episodes, but haven't found the "Th Bride" episode and another. . Outer Limits, . Twilight Zone, . One Step Beyond, . The Inner Sanctum were the shows to watch for sci-fi, horror on TV as a kid. . All of the programs, not only entertained but also made you think, dream and look at the world, thinking of the future.
