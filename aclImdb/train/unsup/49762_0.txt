"After the first 5 minutes there is nothing worth watching in this film" (xnix444).Yes, but even the first 5 minutes are really bad. The intro with the sword seems to be stolen by 'Conan the barbarian' (also 1982), but in quality not even close to it."It has possibly the worst score in film history." (eightx10)Yes, that is also true. The score is scary!"The production values are terrible; the writing, nonexistent." (yngue)Yes, I agree and have nothing more to say about that. Even "The Barbarians" (1987) is a true masterpiece compared to this crap.Rating: 1 of 10.
