Bad 08/15 story. They made the same failures like made in Final Fantasy(Spirits within). It's an standard, I would call it "american story". Not funny. And to technically without spirit.Probably I have watched to many Ghibli movies. And there is not one character I like. They are all stupid and to "designed".watch an good German made (animation-)movie watch "Obelix and Asterix in Amerika".Another tip: Watch this movie without sound, it's a really nice CG Animation without story.
