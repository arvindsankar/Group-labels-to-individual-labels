A marvelous, if little known, early John Wayne film. There are so many wonderful moments in this film that I can only list a few: Harry Carey splendid as the mysterious man who comes to the Ozarks to purchase a piece of dirt land and settle down, and ends up purchasing Moanin' Meadow. A gorgeous, seamless, seemingly effortless piece of acting.Betty Field, always in bare feet saying that she nearly stepped in a cloud and reveling in the mud between her bare toes.Marc Lawrence trying to catch dust motes in a sunbeam coming through a dirty windowpane.Beulah Bondi making a circle of candles and lamp oil!!Marjorie Main seeing for the first time in her life.And John Wayne moving from bewildered and embittered young man with a curse on him, to a man in love who can't express his feeling because of the curse, and finally coming to terms with his real, inner self for the first time in his life.Anyone who thinks John Wayne could not act, should see The Shepherd of the Hills. He is not only beautiful to look at, but he brings charm, power and sympathy to a very difficult role.
