Disappointing follow-up to the phenomenal Scream Greats Vol 1 eschews the planned focus on esteemed contemporary horror film figures, instead embracing sensationalist examination of and commentary on, you guessed it, satanism and witchcraft.Of little interest to rational Fangoria or Starlog readers, it consequently killed the series dead.Originally, bearded filmmaker Tobe Hooper was to be the focus of this installment. What went wrong?Recommended for superstitious adolescents and gullible adults, only.Otherwise, don't bother.
