There is absolutely nothing original in this movie.First Rip: The Girl in the road who has escaped from the psycho is ripped right out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Second Rip: Use of a chain saw for graphic death was once again ripped from TCMThird Rip: The group of kids going strait to the killers house is yet again from TCMFourth Rip: Their college Kids! Horror movie's off college kids left and right. come on please. How about some originality.Fifth Rip: The set up car accident is a possible rip from the GOD AWFUL Wolf Creek.Though I never saw wrong turn I have heard that there is a wrong turn feeling to this movie. Bottom line people this movie holds nothing original. It can be avoided but it's not a complete waste.
