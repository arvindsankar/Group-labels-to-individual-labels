A Perfect Murder ( a loose remake of 혩Dial M for Murder ) is astylish thriller in its own right ,but doesn't come close to theoriginal. As I remember and not to give away any of the plot, 혩Dial혩M' is all about the key. Where it is hidden, Who knew it was there,and who finds it. This plot line is gripping, but in 혩Perfect Murder'this whole part of the story has been overlooked. Having said thatthe film still works quite well, thanks to Michael Douglas. He reallyis superb. Gwyneth Palthrow looks stunning, but David Suchet iswasted as the detective. But where the film really falls down is theending. In the original the last scenes are gripping in the hunt forthe key, but for some reason director Andrew Davis sees fit to endwith the standard formula of a shoot out. Having said that the filmis still worth seeing, but if you need to watch this story, Irecommend the original.
