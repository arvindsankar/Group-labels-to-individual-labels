This so called gay slasher horror film is non of the 3.It is so darkly lit & with constant facial close-ups,you cannot tell what is happening. SPOILER ALERT, as soon as I saw one guy in flamboyant Drag & a cute young guy, I felt that they would be victims,It was also filmed in West Hollywood, It sure did not look like the West Hollywood I know so well.I feel sorry for those that spent $ 11:00 or more on this in the theatres. I saw this on NETFLIX so my cost was very reasonable* 1/2 out of 4 36 points out of 11 2 IMDb
