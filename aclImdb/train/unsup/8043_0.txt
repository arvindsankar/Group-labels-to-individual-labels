could somebody PLEASE tell me what the plot of this film is all about?OK, I gathered from the synopsis that it was about two weary travellers who stop off at a creepy castle for help, and they get into bother. Other than that, though, the film made absolutely NO sense whatsoever.'Nude for Satan' just comes across as a rather pathetic excuse for loads of soft-porn love-in sessions.The production design itself was very reasonable (apart from the odd dodgy special effects, and wobbly bedpost)At one point, I was practically falling asleep while watching this film.A similar movie, 'Bloodsucker leads the dance' is far superior in comparison (by the way, if you've seen "Bloodsucker Leads The Dance", you'll have noticed that the very same sets used in "Nude For Satan" also appear in that film).The only thing to recommend this film is a highly atmospheric music score, otherwise, this is certainly one film I certainly wouldn't go out of my way for!!
