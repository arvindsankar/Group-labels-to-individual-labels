This is really not a very good comedy. Although I have enjoyed watching Corolla as a comedian and on such Comedy Central shows as "The Man Show", this is a poorly assembled, no-surprise comedy.I guess the real benchmark in a comedy is whether it makes you laugh or not. This one doesn't have much that even made the group I was watching it with laugh...or even grin.There's no chemistry at all between Corolla and the female lead. A long, long, long scene at the La Brea Tar Pits just feels like the Woody Allen scene with Diane Keaton in the planetarium from "Manhattan". Redone.I did enjoy the actor playing the Nicaraguan sidekick, but its not enough to recommend you wasting 91 minutes of time on this.Sad to say I bought it from a clearance table at a video store. Something should have told me it was a turkey seeing the large stack of them for sale at $6.You're funnier than this, Adam...I expected more.One star.
