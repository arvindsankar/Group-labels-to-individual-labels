Ah, yes the 1-line summary is what I would describe the film.Considering the U.S. child pornography laws, I'm surprised U.S. government has let this movie to be produced.Looks like the Louis Malle had the guts to make a movie that has nude scene of a young girl named Brooke Shields.Perhaps that is why this movie must be significant.It's not surprising to see a lot of reviewers bashing this movie because of the nudity scene.
