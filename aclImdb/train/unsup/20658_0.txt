this is a passive movie by ace director anthony minghella, the movie has an awesome star cast and they all give competent performances early in their careers.the movie does not have much of a plot and though the story seems veers to a cliched and predictable end, there are enough minor twists that abound in the movie, making it quite an enjoyable watch. the standout features of the movie include its tight script, terrific lines and smart performances.the plot in itself is no great shakes but this movie is a fun watch for a relaxed evening.an enjoyable and pleasant 7!
