What is not too clear is if the TV show inside the film has been made with real actors or not.It says that it is different than the TV show "Est" but some of the sequences are the same. I have seen some of the clips of "Est" reality show on the web. They even had one with a dog! The dog was locked in the dark and kept for a month. The dog became gradually completely dominated. I have seen clips of "Est" with contestants asleep for a few minutes. If that was a preview, how long do they sleep inside the TV show for? It might be therapeutic to watch people sleeping for hours in the dark, especially if some are in the nude.Real or not real, "Complete Map of the Universe" is great. A CULT film! Does anyone know where to buy the full TV series of "EST" on DVD? It's not currently on Amazon.
