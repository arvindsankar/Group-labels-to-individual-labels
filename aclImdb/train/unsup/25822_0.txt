I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic movies; for some reason, the thought of civilization as we know it grinding to a halt on a backdrop of nuclear bombs falling intrigues me to no end.There are a host of movies that deal with Life After The Bomb, a whole lot more dealing with Life While Preventing The Bomb, but not very many that deal with Life Immediately Before The Bomb. This is one of the latter, and I think it pulls it off really well.This offbeat movie chronicles a few hours in the life of a character who has just found out that the missiles are on the way.This movie is rather offbeat; the acting is not bad, but just unlike normal hollywood acting, even despite a few familiar faces. The pacing is different, the sets are different, the colors are different. And in this case, the differences give it an edge that is quite intriguing.The main character (tom cruise's ill-fated co-pilot in top gun) displays such an acute, personal anxiety that really grabbed my attention and really made the movie hit home.While some of the other acting is less than stellar, in a movie like this it does not detract.This movie really did make me think about what I would do in a similar situation. Very thought-provoking.If you are as intriguied by nuclear war as I am, you should definitely watch this film.8 / 10
