Extremely unfunny movie that utterly wastes the usually hilarious Hank Azaria (Huff, the Simpsons et al).The main problem is Simon Pegg. He's well pegged out and will soon reach Ricky Gervaise levels of tedious one note shtick. It's not that the comedy isn't juvenile -- (I mean, American Pie was juvenile) it's just that's it not very funny.Ealing this ain't. More like a blown up sitcom. The UK just can't make funny movies any more. Sorry, but it's true.Go see Knocked Up again rather than waste your time on this tosh, as did all the cast.Still, at least Hugh Grant wasn't it in -- the one redeeming feature.
