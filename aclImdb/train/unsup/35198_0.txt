not great nothing new.ghost looked like a mask for 2 dollars for Halloween.production value is OK compared to the budget...i got bored, and had to fast forward to get to end, which was well untouching.some of the production team members are writing comments of praisal, and giving 10/10 ... we'll those people suck.a a anot the worst... but definitely NOT a good movie. wouldn't miss anything by skipping this one.
