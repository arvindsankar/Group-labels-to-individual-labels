This is a movie without use. The title tells all: Translate into English (any continental variety)...it means something very close to"...The Giant Big."The film itself is worse. How, exactly, did the "creators" imagine the repeated use of the same shots would be un-noticed? How, exactly, did the "director" expect his audience wouldn't notice repeated reverse shots from lines earlier in the film? etc. etc.Don't buy. Don't rent. Don't steal.Ignore it.Maybe the glaciers will grind it to dust.
