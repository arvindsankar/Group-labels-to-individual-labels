Simply put 'Ring 2: Spiral' is not as scary as the first one, but likemost classic horror films (except for Aliens, if you consider that tobe a horror film), sequels don't have the privilege of fresh shockvalues of the original movie. Especially if the second movie, as isthe case with 'Ring 2', serves the purposes of explaining thebackground further from the first movie. With knowledge comespower and with this power, the protagonists in the movie and theaudience can fight back a portion of their fear. I may also add thatthis sequel is more schizophrenic in its direction and visualizationthan the first one. This may have been intended by Nakata assporadic confusion that disturbs our sub-conscious perspective,but it also prevents the film from being able to move forward to abuilding climaxes, at least not as powerful and thrilling as in 'Ring'.SPOILERs Nevertheless there were genuine horrific scenes, as scary as in'Ring': the revelation of Shizuko's background, her apparition in theryokan and the chase within the well with Sadako. It's a pity that thecharacter of Reiko is killed off by a runover accident rather than bythe curse itself. But the surprising appearance of Ryuji was a reward and it'ssimulteneously disturbing to know that his soul is also trappedwithin the well.Overall 'Ring 2' may lack the suspense and horror of itspredecessor but it managed to deliver the same tone of hauntingatmosphere and revealed the dark secrets of Sadako. Personally,the professional use of the same cast, crew and director is alwaysa treasure in a series like this. I'd have given this movie 8/10 but Fukada Kyoko (who according tomy Japanese friend, is a good actress), had been mis-casted.She has been too well known, outside Japan, as more of apop-idol or pin-up girl. Hence her characterization of one of thevictims is quite unbelievable, not to mention that she became asecond 'video ghost' herself.
