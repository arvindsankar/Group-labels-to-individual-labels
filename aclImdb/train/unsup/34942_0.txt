The sequel to romancing the stone is rather disappointing.The plot is shallow, humour is dry, and the whole atmosphere of the first is just not there.I wish those responsible for its production could see that and realize that this was not meant to be as memorable as the first.Nevertheless if you decide to watch this film, it is not what you call boring and overall it is just pleasant watching Douglas and Turner getting into trouble with their unexpected friend De Vito adding a bit of fun tone in the process.4/10
