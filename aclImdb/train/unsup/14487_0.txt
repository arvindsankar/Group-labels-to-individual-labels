It's a pity!That this movie has come and gone without any fan fare.It is a beautiful dance movie with wonderful haunting music and moves.The acting is sometimes kind of hammy and out of place. You can tell that the leading lady is a very gentle lady and that yelling screaming are not her style. The scenes where she is overly emotional are false.It is such a treat for the over the hill gang to see the Masters dance with such wild abandon.Overall, it is a dance movie and it honors the mature dancers.It is both flawed and wonderful.I will recommend it to family and friends. Rent it and watch it!
