The four points come from good cinematography, sound-production, and special effects.Nomore points from me... this was boring, predictable, used only clich√©s... hair, phone, somebody running out of focus...For serious horror-addicts nothing to be seen here. But I've seen worse...I didn't get scared at all... I like black metal, horrorcore, ... and other disturbing sh*t.OOOooohhooohhhohohohhohhh.... Oooohhohoh...Man the phone part just sux =D
