Jim Jarmusch disappointingly falls short with his latest offering of Coffee and Cigarettes. Although visually attractive and with a great cast to support, the series of shorts unfortunately are let down by the series of poor scripts.On first viewing I found myself fast forwarding through the film, looking for "the good parts", though really I didn't give it a chance .... Then with time to spare, I gave it another go. There were a couple of highlights, fans of Steve Coogan (Alan Partridge, 24 Hour Party People), will enjoy the 'cousins?' conversation with Alfred Molina (Chocolat, Spiderman 2). And Iggy Pop gives an amusing performance playing himself in the company of the intimidating Tom Waits. Maybe this would have worked better as individual shorts, shown over a duration of weeks "Jim Jarmusch Presents", rather than as a complete collection.As a whole it just didn't work as a film ... JJs worst effort to date.You'll need more than Coffee and Cigarettes to stay awake through this one.For more insight into the reasons behind the film, you maybe interested in this article. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4972055/site/newsweek/
