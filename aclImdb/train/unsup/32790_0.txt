Kate Davis (Chantal Contouri) is abducted by a group that has been watching her every move. It seems that she's an descendant of Elizabeth 'the Blood Countess' Bathory, yes the Hungarian whore herself. This secret cabal of wealthy individuals feed on peasants who live on a commune. It's not hard to find the ripe political symbolism there. It feels like it goes on to long, and the vampire 'effects' are incredible silly. One couldn't help but feel that the movie would have been better served by going to its approach to vampirism the same way as "Martin" did.My Grade: C- DVD Extras: Commantary track; Isolated film score; Filmographies; Photo Gallery Theatrical Trailer; and 3 TV spots Eye Candy: Chantal Contouri shows breasts
