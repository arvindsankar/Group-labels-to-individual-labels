This is a awful movie. Another teenager movie but this time with Jason.This movie is full of bad jokes, poor writing and very poor imagination. The ones from the 80's are far better than this one.The girls in this movie serve two purpose only: They are there to show their body and to show some sex scenes. The guys look like Ken (Barbies boyfriend) and came straight from the model agency. The only thing that matters is that they look good on film. No one cares if they can't perform. Obviously the director didn't care.And what about Jason? Well, Jason had some evolution. He can use a bow and arrow now becoming Jason Hood. He runs (wich is fine) and he looks at himself in the mirror (even Jason cares about looks now). Oh and for some reason he can travel at light speed because he changes from place to place so goddamn fast.This isn't a horror movie. Its a comedy with some gore (not too much). I was hoping to see a remake with the quality of Halloween (from Rob Zombie) but this is even worse than Freddy vs. Jason (and that one is really bad).And please! If any director is reading this. Please!!! Avoid the stupid racial and teenager jokes. No one cares about them and they ruin the whole movie feeling.I gave it a 4 for 2 reasons only: Jason is back and he keeps doing is stuff.Avoid this movie if you can. And my advice is to not even spend money renting it.
