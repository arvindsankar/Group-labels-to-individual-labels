This plot seems to be exactly like the one in the danish movie "MÃ¸rkeleg" from 1996.The plot in that one: "Four high school friends meet up in an abandoned house to play 'Backstabbed', a game of murder with headphones and plastic weapons. Meanwhile, a serial killer is leaving a trail of blood on his way to the house, and soon the game of murder becomes much more than make-believe"And that also sucked!How about the writers making their own movie, or at least label it with a "re-make" sticker! In my opinion, the movie gets even worse when you figure out that you have seen it all before.And what the hell is up with you guys and the "hot chicks" A movie has never been better because of "hot chicks" Rent a porno flick, at least they have better plots!
