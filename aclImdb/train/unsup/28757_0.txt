How can a movie be so stupid, so unbelievably stupid, as to have Heather Thomas in a major role, then not give her more screen time??Can you tell I'm a fan of hers?I'm no fan of "Zapped!", though. Everyone's an idiot in this movie, and those who aren't end up looking stupid sooner or later. You see, Baio plays a high school nerd who gets special telepathic powers thanks to this concoction he makes up in chem class. With these powers, he can either make the world a better place by ending war, disease and famine... or just use it to rig ball games, roulette wheels and pop open Heather's blouse. Guess which road he takes?Come on, it's an '80s movie, dude!At least Baio and Aames worked well enough together here to star together in TV's "Charles in Charge" later on. As far as everything else goes: bad special effects, bad script, bad judgment to use old fogies like Baio as high school students, VERY BAD under-use of Heather Thomas. And bad use of Felice Schachter.Who's Felice Schachter?Exactly.Two stars. One for Heather, and an extra one just to give her moral support for this ordeal.It's okay, Heather. we're here for you.
