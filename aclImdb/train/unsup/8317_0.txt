I personally loved the movie. You may not figure it all out, in fact I'msure that you won't figure it all out. It's one of those movies... but it'sa GOOD ONE! Besides, Seth Green, Ted Raimi, and Jeffery Combs all rock!As for scariness, I don't rate it very high, although there are plentyof good scenes that are pretty freaky. Of course, not many films scare me much. I highly suggest seeing this movie, if it seems at all like the sort offilm you're into.
