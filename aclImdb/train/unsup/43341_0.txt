When I heard about the movie Fool 'N' Final, I thought it would be a complete comedy, but it turned out to be the complete opposite.PROBLEMS 1. way too many characters (and it really bothered me the way they put Sameera Reddy in the movie just for eye candy. my mom could have done her role, and she doesn't even speak Hindi) 2. too many plots, and a lot of pointless scenes 3. NOT FUNNY!The cast of this movie, you could say, are all pretty good actors. I really wish they hadn't wasted their time with this movie AND DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME EITHER!
