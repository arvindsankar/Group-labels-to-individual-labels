I've got good news, & I've got bad news.The good? Michelle is very fine - convincing sad mommy, Barbie cute, emoticon deluxe.E.McG - not around enough. There must have been an editing mess with this one. The first part of the film suggests he would have had a bigger role. Our loss.That's the good.The bad: THIS IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE!!!! It's a ruminative, junky, maudlin, meandering mess masquerading as an action movie. No guts, no punch.It takes a long time to say - & you will be half asleep at this point - that, gee, Osama should just listen to the sad mommas out there & he wouldn't be such a bad dude.NO. This is idiotic. Terrorists are NOT good daddies. Not possible.The whole thing takes a long time to develop & then falls apart in semi-bathetic babbling. Like I said, wha' happened?
