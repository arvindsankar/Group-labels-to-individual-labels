I am quite tolerable with B class movies. They don't have big budgets so they work with rubbish/old timer/carriers never took off artists and thats OK. As long as they have a nice script and don't try to compete with big guys, they do just fine. However this movie...1) This is the second time they released a movie with Starship Troopers title that is ABSOLUTELY rubbish. The main story is not too bad but side stories are ridiculous.2) You don't expect anything philosophical from a Starship Troopers movie but the lines are at best copied from the first movie. All the characters talk in a very cheesy way.3) The CGI's are Xbox level, not even PS3. Especially the scenes with Marouders feel like they are coming from a low budget computer game (deer hunter, anyone?)4) Half the movie is wasted with religious talks, that lead nowhere. Makes you wander whether Vatican sponsored the movie. At one point I expected to see the pope jumping from a landing craft and start killing bugs. Its at that level, no kidding.All-and-all, I'm glad I watched this one at a friend and didn't spend any money (just my time, which is bad enough). And it also made me sad for the actors. Casper Van Dien's movie carrier never took off, so I guess it is fair to assume he needed the money. But Jolene Blalock was a rising star two years ago. Her acting skills are limited but everybody loved her in Star Trek. What forced her to join this movie is a mystery to me. I guess she also needed the money wanted to finish and go home because like everybody else, her acting was extremely cheesy.
