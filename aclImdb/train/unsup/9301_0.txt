A typical low budget thriller/horror movie with a cast that doesn't bring much excitement to an experienced viewer, but then again not that bad either since none of them gave me the creeps.The story itself is thin and we sort of jump straight into the story after very few introductions.It's dark and windy most of the time to make sure the viewer can't point out the obvious 3D structures most of the movie is made out of.But it is also slick and polished at the same time and nothing sort of fall into your eyes as irregular, it's just the feeling that this isn't how it would be looking in real life.Some of the special effects are very nice such as the various fish types they have made for the caves and the whole thing could easily pass as real if I hadn't been into 3D artistry from before.You get a few thrills from the action scenes and after watching it I felt like I hadn't wasted a good hour and a half, but then again I could have found something else to do also without loosing a good nights sleep over missing this film.I give it a 5 for the special effects and the smoothness.
