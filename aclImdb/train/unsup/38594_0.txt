Mulchay was NOT the enemy here. He was forced by the producers and the film company to release the abomination that resulted. He even walked out of the premiere within 15 minutes because he was so disgusted with what the movie company did.It wasn't until a few years ago that he went back and "fixed" it as best as he could and released it on DVD (the Renegade version).In 2005, they released it again, called the special edition, which had minor "fixes" but other than that, it was the Renegade version which is by far the better version to watch.But, to say Mulchay should be poisoned is going to the extreme. True, he could have stopped, but for whatever reason, he didn't. Even Lambert was about ready to walk off the set, but he couldn't due to contractual agreements.
