I thought I had written a review of this travesty of a movie.There was absolutely nothing worthwhile in it . I agree with the last reviewer its too much nose candy.They use a hand held camera to the extreme, I have seen better hand held camera work on "youtube."The acting is second rate by a well known cast.I will not insult them by naming them, same for the director & writer.This was filmed on the beautiful Cayman Islands,It should have been done on the Santa Monica beach, that is how much it looked like the Caymans.Rating * (out of 4) 25 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
