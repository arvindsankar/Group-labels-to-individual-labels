We love movies of all kinds. This movie was filmed in Finland by a Finnish director who appears to be trying to imitate spy movies from James Bond to Mission Impossible...and they did a very poor job of imitating. Sadly, some really good American actors worked on this film. It was apparently made as a serious movie, but even Netflix lists this as a spy 'farce'.If you like the Scary Movie or Airplane type movies, you might like this one OK - no way you could like it that much.We really like Bill Pullman, but this movie would made you doubt his movie making decisions.The music is awful (retro) and the speaking volume level is way too low compared to the music volume.I'd say, get a different movie.
