Eddie Quillan gives one of his worst performances as Ellery Queen. The plot involves the theft of a rare stamp and the murders that occur in its wake. Quillan, as Queen gets involved with the mystery after he meets the owner when she arrives in New York by boat.The mystery itself is fine. I can even live with the cheapness of the production (nothing looks real). What I can't stand are the performances, no one in this cast with the exception of Frank Pangborn gives anything remotely like a performance. Can't anyone on screen act? I guess not. The worst offender is Quillan who turns Ellery Queen into an insufferable twit. I wanted to smack him. Charming or disarming he's not. He ruins what could have been an okay bad movie.I hate this movie, I hate it a great deal.
