A story of messed up real life people trying to find a happy hollywood ending, almost real life for a change.Nicholson is fantastic getting all the quick witted replies and comments that he deserves, and Hunt provides a fantastic lead opposite him and the pair blend beautifully together in their scenes.Gooding and Kinnear provide strong support, but it's Kinnear who outshines Gooding, why haven't we seen him in more prominent roles before?The film can get a bit sappy in places, but it always brings it back to reality with a bang.Definately a go see, for all those Victor Meldrew types.
