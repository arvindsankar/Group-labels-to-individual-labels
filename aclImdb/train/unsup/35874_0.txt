I have been a big fan of MK since the beginning, although I must admit I lost interest in the game series after part III.Buying MK Deception this past Christmas renewed my interest in the series.This movie was crap and I can't believe I bought this mess.Good thing I found it for 9.99 at the used bin, so I wasn't out of much.I was expecting to see a REAL sequel to the first movie, which I found fairly entertaining.I thought the first film was very good and does the game upon which it is based some justice.Not the case with MKA.The first problem is that they tried to fuse too much of MK2 with MK3.Then, if you're going to replace a character with another actor (Christopher Lambert), then at least make sure the new actor does a batter job than the first. The first Raiden was a hard-ass, and you knew not to mess with him. The second Raiden was a wuss and every time we saw him he was going through a wall.Weak portrayals of major MK characters was another flaw.The actress who portrayed Sonya Blade was nowhere near as good as Bridgette Wilson (the first Sonya).Same could be said with Cage (Linden Ashby).What was the point of even having Ermac and Rain in the movie if they weren't going to be referred to? A very weak portrayal of Sindel, Kitana's mother and the actress who played her isn't fit to act in soap operas.Line example: Kitana: "My mother is dead." Sindel: "As will be her daughter!" Gimmie a break! Stick with the first.
