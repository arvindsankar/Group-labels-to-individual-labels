Out with the old n with the new...I like this movie because of its rare style similar to the lost skeleton of cadavra.Great no name cast.an speaking of namesI thought the raspberry brothers should have used their real names.though I have read a few reviews that hated this DVD because of the changes what not in the film or score, but I think the f.b.i had something to do with this, so its the politics of DVD they should be upset with.a classic si fi treat.
