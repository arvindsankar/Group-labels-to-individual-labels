That Movie is not a great production but gives interesting lighting to some mankind old Obsessions.1st : The Plot is a view of man's race against time.(42 hours to save Mankind)2nd : The Relationship between the crew, underlines man's rejection of the difference. (Blair is a Half-Pilgrim, and so is Paladin) One claims it, and is rejected, the other one Behaves all the contrary but is just similar in the end (Keeping distance).3rd : The Place chosen for the plot shows man fascination for new Frontiers. With new Frontiers, Man find new enemies, and this disguises that the Enemy is inside. Untolerance of the difference. Mankind wants a Universe for her, on her model.Everything seems nice, but I have a regret, the Production thought it would be better to target a public of teenagers, and this cost that movie Perfect rating.Yours sincerely.Jan.
