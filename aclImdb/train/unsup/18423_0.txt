I found this movie absolutely arresting and poetic. The shots were beautiful and the characters serene. The dialect was so well orated by the actors. Tapas Paul is such a good actor. And its brave of him to experiment with such artsy films despite his urban star status. Being away from my own home, I can relate to the importance of letters which later became phone calls and now emails. Dasgupta is a class act and I love the way he picturizes his films and tells his stories. Its so beautiful and there is so much depth into the stories. I wish to see more such films from our contemporary Bengali filmmakers because we are not really only pop culture. Granted it could be slow for people who are used to the commercial cinema and Bollywood but this is a must see for all art lovers.
