If you want to see a movie about things that will happen when you stop taking your medication, then this is a movie to see. I guess if you think way into things, it is a creepy movie, but just watching it, its not that bad. I saw it at the NuArt in LA and I really could have waited.The cinematography was interesting, and the camera was really shaky at times. However, due to the fact that it was filmed in 8 days, I do give them props.One more thing, the movie tends to drop focus points...and has minimal dialogue.
