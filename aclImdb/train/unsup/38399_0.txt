I have to agree. What a really awful movie. This was just a poor ripoff at a time when poor ripoffs weren't as common as now.Sigh...The original Westworld takes a good concept and works well. The attempts to tie futureworld back to Westworld are poorly structured.Wooden performances abound, not just from the 'robots' either.Watch Westworld and skip the sequel.Another reasonable pick for an odd Yul Brenner movie is an odd post-apocalyptic knife fighter flick.Aardvaark
