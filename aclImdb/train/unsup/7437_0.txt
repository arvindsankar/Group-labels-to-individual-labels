The Season ends with a very excitable bang and leaves us in suspense from the very start. The year has been a very excitable and interesting year and I have loved every minute of it, good and bad. I shall now do my last Good and Bad for Season 1, The Erlenmeyer Flask. Enjoy.The Good: That alien baby was adorable. x]The final scene. Beautifully done.Those bodies in the glass. Wow.Deep Throat. Trust him or not?The Bad: The whole shooting thing. :'(Conclusion: Brilliant end of a brilliant First Season. I want to believe. 10/10
