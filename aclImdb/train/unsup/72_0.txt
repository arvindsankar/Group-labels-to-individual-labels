I saw this movie by accident and i love it since.I got the DVD and in quiet moments I dig it out and watch it again...It's one of those rare films that keeps you watching while the story is flying by. The Characters fits the story and I also like the energy between the characters. The chosen music is excellent and keeps everything together.I wouldn't say it's realistic, that a boy rapes an unconscious women. But who never dreamed of an unconscious girl..:P In the end Julietta tries to make everything work and that makes her character even more appealing. I love the persons and the Music. Great Film.And to the others, who always compare one film with another: Live is not that easy to compare. Like the title says. Greetings
