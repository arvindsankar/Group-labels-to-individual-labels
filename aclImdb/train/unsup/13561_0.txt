A great movie documentary telling of the early days of the Warner Brothers toon studios (think of "Termite Terrace" as you watch), along with nine great toon shorts the family will love for a long time to come.This movie should be watched for on Showtime (or any of its other channels). Too bad it's not on video now--it should be taped!I must agree, it's a family film that indeed shall be grater than any others that will proclaim so in future.So long live BUGS...long live the MERRIE MELODIES...and LONG LIVE THE LOONEY TUNES!!An agreeable 10\10 effort from the United Artists team.
