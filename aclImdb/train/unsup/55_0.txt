I loved this film when I was a kid and I know a lot of you have been having difficulty finding a copy. I found this guy online that makes DVD transfers of the film on English dub with menus and everything:http://8store.8thman.com/ta3.htmI ordered the import from Japan as well but that doesn't have English subs or dubs. I think these transfers will be true to the childhood experience we remember.I remember watching this film over and over on a VHS tape when I was little but that tape has long gone and I am aching for a DVD version. Hopefully Sanrio reproduces this classic on DVD because there is definitely a cult following. I've been seeing bootlegs of this going for as much as $70 on eBay!
