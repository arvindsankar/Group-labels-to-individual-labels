Yes, I remember this show.After growing up enjoying Emergency with Mantooth and Tighe, we were given this return to rescue stunts.But it failed to measure up.Essentially what 240 Robert did was bring Mark Harmon to the limelight.Other than that, the show was awful.And pray tell, what did the numbers mean? I asked my brother, named Robert."Two wheels, four wheels and no wheels," he replied, as rescues were done on motorcycles (yes, a la CHiPs), four wheeled vehicles and the helicopter."But why use the name 'Robert'?" I asked further."Because it is a wonderful name," Robert replied.
