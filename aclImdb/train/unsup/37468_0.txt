there was nothing good about this movie nothingnothingif i could give it negative stars i wouldif i was missing some sort of underlying "purposely-awful-movie-for-the-sake-of-irony" vibethen i might understand moresome scenes attempt introspective depth and just come off as being cheesythe humor is interspersed in a sporadic low-brow waythe impression it gives me is that the author only respects artists who are good at realism before they paint abstract thingsthe movie gives off an alienating attitude and shallow view of the subject filmedthe characters are mediocre at bestit's too bad cause ghost world wasn't that bad
