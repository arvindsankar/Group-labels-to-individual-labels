Really, if you have insomnia, watch this move. I sleep after watching half of the movie.This movie is basically about a special agent/assassin who fails in a mission and is sent to an island for "reeducation".Ultimate Force will only please those Mirko "Croatian Cop" Filipovic hardcore fans and nobody else. Cro Cop acting is bad. Specially when he's fighting... You'll not see a lot of MMA (Vale-tudo) fights in this movie which is a shame.And it's funny how he uses this movie to show some despite to a certain Brazilian Vale-Tudo fighter. The only part of the movie that made me laugh out loud.
