This was a very enjoyable film, but is very difficult to get access to.I saw it on broadcast television while in Portland.The film has wicked British wit, and has heavy surrealistic aspects to its production. Don't try to watch the movie from a causality standpoint (if A and B then C), just sit back and enjoy the ride.If you can't stand surrealism, or if your movies MUST have a plot, steer clear of this title.This is not really a spoiler, but don't read further if you just want the full impact of this wacky title.The main character is dreadfully afraid that he is going to turn into an English Bed Sitting Room (a room in a house: Wikipedia "bed sitting room") All of this occurs against the backdrop of the world after it has been nuked to a trash pile. If this doesn't tell you how odd this film is, nothing will.I laughed so hard while watching this movie, I thought I was going to wet myself.
