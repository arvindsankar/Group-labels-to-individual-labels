Drive Thru is one of the top 5 horror movies of all time in my book. Everything comes together so well - the fast paced action, the subtle political innuendos, and the suspenseful plot twists are all perfectly balanced to create the ideal horror movie experience.The actors all play their roles to perfection - Jan and Hunter from the office!!! - and the soundtrack is nothing short of spectacular. The character meet their deaths in a widely entertaining variety of ways (mostly involving a clown with an axe).The guy from Supersize Me makes a highly ironic cameo as a fast food cashier, which was a great creative casting twist.SPOILER ALERT!! Snape kills Dumbledore!You will be left speechless at the end of the movie, which has a twist of a magnitude unheard of since the Sixth Sense. I am anxiously awaiting the sequel, Drive Thru 2 starring Keanu Reeves.
