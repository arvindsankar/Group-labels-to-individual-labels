I thought this movie was very refreshing and original.Adrian Grenier, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joey Lauren Adams all gave convincing performances, especially Gellar whose performance I see as a real departure from her other roles.This movie is definitely for the 17 + crowd as it contains blatant sex scenes and drug use but it's definitely worth seeing.It has an original plot, innovative filming and hilarious dialogue in parts. Although containing scenes of drug use, the movie is not really about that.You have to check this out when you get the chance... 7/10
