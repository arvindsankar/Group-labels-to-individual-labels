This infantile adaptation of Jonathan Swift's  shows that the creators were simply not up to the task. It depicts only one of Gulliver's four journeys, and fails to render even that accurately. The film communicates none of the themes of Swift's literary classic. Instead, the creators fabricate a Capulet and Montague style feud that captures none of the absurdity of Lilliputian politics, the grotesquerie of Gulliver's size, or the misplaced pride of both Gulliver and the Lilliputians. In fact, in this version, Gulliver does not speak until 40 minutes into the 75-minute film.Aside from the fact that Gulliver washes upon the shore of Lilliput where he is restrained by tiny people, the plot of the cartoon bears virtually no resemblance to Gulliver's voyage to Lilliput.**** spoiler this paragraph ****A series of Snow White inspired string-laden ballads separates scenes of insipid Lilliputian gags. The only clever turn is Prince David rescuing--rather than slaying--the Goliath-like Gulliver.**** spoilers done ****I'd steer clear of this, even for the kids, as there is plenty of better material out there for all of you to enjoy.3 of 10
