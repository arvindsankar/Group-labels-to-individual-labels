This is one of my five favorite comedy movies.Mary Gross gives an inspired and hilarious performance as the nerdy, neophyte, near-Fed.Rebecca De Mornay is perfect as the straight foil for Mary, and Fred Thompson did a much better job of impersonating an FBI instructor than he ever did at impersonating a Senator.Tony Longo as the sailor in the bar was also outstanding.It also had a great beat, and was easy to dance to. I give it an 80, Dick.
