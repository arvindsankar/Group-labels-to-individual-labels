I had high hopes for this movie, waiting for to be "touched". And what a disappointment it was.This movie is like watching zombies moving from place to place.And yes i got the idea what makers tried to get across, but this movie didn't touch me a bit. It had no soul.Props for great cinematography here and there though.SPOILERS A HEAD!!!And how stupid can you be, to stay in the same room with delirious man who is trying to shoot you, just to wait and wait and wait until you shoot that man. Makes no sense... Normal people would have run out of that house and at least waited until he had run out of bullets.
