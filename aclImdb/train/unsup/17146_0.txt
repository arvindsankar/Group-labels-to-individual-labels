This movie tale brings to life the classic story in a way that makes it the best retelling of it I've ever seen. Music, a handsome wolf, and a depth of plot that is hardly ever seen in a story that was once so basic.There are a bunch of great songs in this movie: So good at being bad You should never talk to strangers Blue in the green You won't be there in the morning The man without a heart My favorite quote:"King: You don't love anything, do you? Dagger: I love hunting with the pack under a full moon..I love a romantic dinner by candlelight..The two don't seem to go together do they?
