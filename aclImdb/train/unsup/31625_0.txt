Another of the lost RKO films shown on TCM this month.William Powell plays a playboy vaguely interested in Ann Harding, whose family crashed in the Depression. Harding is a woman who believes in marrying for love but gets pushed into trapping Powell into marriage (for his money).Nice little story with two top stars who have great chemistry together. And the story isn't as dour as it sounds.Lucille Browne is the odious sister. Henry Stephenson is the father. Lillian Bond is the gold digger. Kay Hammond is the friend. Reginald Owen is the butler.Nice little film.
