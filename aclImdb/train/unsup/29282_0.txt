(No real spoiler but hints at the direction of the episode.)I have to agree with the statements that that this was one of the best episodes this season. The constant redirection, the outrageous things done to the boxer, not to mention the whole "boxer trains at a brothel" idea are some of the most creative of the season. I really like the continuity of this season. Events and plot lines from previous episodes affect the characters as the season progresses. But every once in a while, you just have to have fun and break away from the formula. It allows both the writers and the actors some freedom from having to continue to answer questions from previous episodes, while still allowing consistent character development.But, to my summary. I wondered where I had seen the actress playing one of the "pleasure providers." I realized she was the daughter in "What Women Want." She has really grown up.EDIT: I just realized where I had seen Doris Babinkian (the "madam"): Sister Mary Robert from the Sister Act movies. Talk about growing up.....
