Ok don't get me wrong, I love vampire and horror films, but I have to say this is the only horror film that I've actually fallen asleep trying to watch, and not even the wonderful Robert Patrick can redeem it.The only mildly redeeming area is friends turned and still pretending to be themselves, but even that wasn't done very wellSorry, but I would only ever recommend this film to someone who has to treat insomnia, otherwise watch something else instead
