"Basilisk" is on right now, the latest CGI monster flick from Sci-Fi, inspired by medieval bestiaries (remember "Manticore"?).The effects are bad, the characters and situations predictable, the monster really badly drawn, but it's another one of those movies that is so bad, you can enjoy laughing at it. And if it weren't for movies like this, actors like Stephen Furst wouldn't have anything to do.At least we get to see Yancy Butler running around in a little cocktail dress.Now I see that there is a minimum line requirement to these comments, so I have to add more content. Let's see...The soldier popping up out of the manhole, begging for help, only to get pulled back in, that's predictable.The lone garbage man who sees the monster as he walks to the dumpster, that's a clich√©, too.Oh, and the producers fulfilled another horror movie requirement by having the monster attack a shopping mall. Take that, you blind consumerist sheep!Ooh, and the monster came to life at a university museum, at a reception for wealthy patrons. Take that, capitalists! Throw in a nutty sidekick, and a hot blonde archeology professor, and we have plenty of the expected building blocks of a shake-and-bake monster movie.Is that enough lines now?I see that it is. Who's idea was that requirement, anyway?
