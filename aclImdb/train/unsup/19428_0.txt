It's always the short (I was wrong. Best, most intense, most depressingly emotional show I have ever watched.This thing is a masterpiece. Instantly became my favourite anime (and show) of all time, beating out Death Note and the like.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! In fact, I pity those who have not watched this. Some people are turned off instantly by the gore and nudity, but these people are ignorant pussies (to put it bluntly).PS: Don't forget to read the manga to find out the REAL ending. Yes, the manga IS better than the anime, and that's saying something.
