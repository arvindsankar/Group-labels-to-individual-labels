A movie about surf, friendship and the hardness in growing up.The movie has great surf pictures, great surfers (Gerry Lopez himself), it has a beautiful script and was very well directed.I think this movie is already a classic for surfers and non-surfers... ;-)I watch the movie in VHS long ago, and iÂ´m waiting for the DVD (next month)
