I'm not sure if the movie was initially meant to be a HORROR movie or a COMEDY.With that said, this movie one I would never recommend - EVER.I enjoy the horror genre, and even the "funny" ones but why movies like this were ever made frightens me.This one particularly lacks acting skills, the director needs to go back to school and the special effects artists work here is an utter joke.Back to the drawing boards guys.Hope this movie was your FIRST attempt.Thank you drive through.
