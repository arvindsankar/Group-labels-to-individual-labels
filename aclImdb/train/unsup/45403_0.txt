No great lines, no memorable scenes (okay, maybe one with theold lady near the end), no interesting twists of fate, no commentson the human condition. A downer of movie, with unrelentinglyunpleasant people being unrelentingly unpleasant. You never getto know any of the people or find out their motivations; just as well.If you're going to rip off David Mamet, you should at least have areal nude scene, not just some steamy pillow talk.Some decent acting (notably Ed Harris) and okay cinematographysaved The Prime Gig from oblivion, but I could give it no higherthan a 2.
