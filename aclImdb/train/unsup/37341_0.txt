if Kate Winslet wasn't in this film i would have never bothered with it.the main kid Kevin is such a loser with the softest voice i wonder how anyone can ever imagine him being a threat.Princess Katey has a horrible accent, not to mention they ruined her character.the only good thing about this film is Kate Winslet, Daniel Craig and Ark Milk. and if only the story was focus on them and their almost love triangle, it would score much higher.Kate Winslet looks every inch the princess and is obviously the best fighter in the film, and the most useful character.Daniel Craig has a head full of blonde hair and a British accent. nuff said.
