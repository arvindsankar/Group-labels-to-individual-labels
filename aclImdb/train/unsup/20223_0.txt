i loved LaChappelle's movie... the dancing (both 'clowin' and 'krumpin') was great.i loved "lil mama"... she was so cute. the 'stripper dance' was funny. a few of my friends do a little bit of that mixed in w/their dances... we didn't know they called it the 'stripper dance' and 'stripper booty'.. we laughed at that.it inspired me n my friends so much so that as soon as we got into the parking lot we started 'krumpin' rite there on the spot!! needless to say, police got involved because it was after curfew and i had my little sis w/us.. so we went home w/those feelings and 'clowned' and 'krumped'... it was "ahh" ::sighs.w/relief::
