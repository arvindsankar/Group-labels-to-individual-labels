I got the weird suspicion this movie was in the news somewhere. Probably involving the large amount of cash spent on it and probably subtly changing everybody's view on it (those who saw the news). Note, that is just my totally uneducated guess.I can't be more objective on this one; I never heard about it, I just accidently saw it on the telly a couple of minutes ago. I was pleasantly surprised...I hear A LOT of: "It's not original"Personally I don't give a damn, I really enjoyed this.I never actually write reviews but this absolutely undeserved score pretty much forced me to; I'd hate it if you passed on this one just because some people are easily influenced by the news they're fed (note - I'm still going on my totally uneducated guess).I actually voted 10, instead of the well deserved 8 just to crank up the ridiculously low score (something I'm actually against, but this was an obvious emergency). I hope you'll do the same if you agree with me.Anyway, just give this one a go and try to be objective about it, if you happened to have 'seen the news'. =)Vote...And enjoy the rest of your life, make it a good one... =)
