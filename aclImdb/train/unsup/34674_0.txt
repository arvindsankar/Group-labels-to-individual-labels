I won't lie to you, this movie was bad. Really bad. It was god awful. But worthy of the bottom 100, I don't know. Kevin McDonald was part of the second greatest sketch comedy show, the Kids in the Hall(second only to the state). Paul Greenberg was in the Vacant Lot, a highly underrated show that I still don't get all of. I admit that I lost a few brain cells due to this movie, but It did have its moments of good comedy. Uh, I really can't think of any, but I know I laughed a few times. Oh god, I 'm remembering the impersonations. so bad so so bad.Honestly, Dom Deluise was better in Loose Cannons and I hated that movie. and Rodney Dangerfeild should kick it so that we can remember how good he was doing stand up and in Caddyshack.This movie was bad even for afternoon Showtime.***out of 10Disclaimer: Still better than Hudson Hawk
