So the plot is definitely straight out of an Elvis movie, and the production values so bad it's almost better to play this one like it was a high school play than a movie. The sets look like fake movie sets in movies about movies.I find two things fascinating about this movie forty years out:(1) what passed for sexually suggestive or titillating once upon a time, which still has some fetishistic appeal (pay attention to Nancy Sinatra's scenes).(2) Exactly how ugly Eric Burdon and all of the Animals were. Come to think of it, everybody in this movie is kinda ugly, at least everybody on stage. The Dave Clark Five made me "Glad All Over" I didn't have a British dentist.But this is a movie worth watching just for the musical performances, and if you like camp or early 60s lingerie you'll have something to get you from the party scene to the telethon scene.
