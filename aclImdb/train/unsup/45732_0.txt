Decent enough cast squandered by stupid plot, inept script, direction, editing.Dont expect any martial arts action either, the only fights are so badly cut and lit that anyone could have done them.Best moment: realising that Dennis Hopper's character is actually supposed to be Irish.Worst moment: realising that it isn't going to get any better than the opening scene.
