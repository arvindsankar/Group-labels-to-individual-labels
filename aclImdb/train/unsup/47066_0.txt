Director Genevieve Robert has attempted to make a comedy-drama that makes serious comment about modern day sexual relations, and with "Casual Sex?" she is well wide of the mark.The storyline is very weak (concerning two young girls' search for the perfect guy), while the serious and moral content makes very little impact. Don't be deceived by the title.Finally, the comedy only works very occasionally, but look out for Andrew Dice-Clay in a stand out performance as the 'Vinman'. "Casual Sex?" may have been much better made purely as a send-up of sex in the 80's.Thursday, July 2, 1992 - Video
