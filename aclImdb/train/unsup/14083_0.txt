i gave it two star because i actually couldn t wait to see what bad acting would come next. or what corny effects would come next.The acting was brutal and the plot so unbelievable I think the actors couldn t wait to finish shooting this movie and it showed on screenRichard Hatch seemed out of place in the woods as opposed to his rocket ships anyway.The props were poor and i have made better cg effects on my old 486It makes you wonder what the people were thinking the whole time they made this film. Maybe this will be a future cult film ....who knows,The ending brought you to your knees as well because you couldn't get up to actually watch the credits.
