Brilliant and beautiful and breathtaking.The flip side of Shakespeare in Love - flipped several times over, but every bit as magical, passionate and fun. What takes this a notch higher than SIL, is the full out portrayal of all sides of human sexuality with absolutely no excuses or pretense.The best thing is that what we do *not* see at the end.Amazing spot-on supporting performances by Rupert Everett, Ben Chapman, Tom Wilkinson, Zoe Tapper, Stockard Channing and so many others.The frightening bizarre hair, makeup and costumes are used so wonderfully in this film to remind us of our of our frailty, vanity, but mostly of our beautiful humanity. No hiding here - from anything. No excuses!The humor is there... the life is there...the cruelty, the spirit, the hypocrisy. All of it.I could see this movie a hundred times and not be bored.Enjoy!
