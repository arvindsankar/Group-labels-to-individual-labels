Jeff Ltd is only limited in its own ability to make its viewers laugh or pay attention.This show is one of the worst travesties ever put on the air.Even by comedy network standards it is pretty much garbage and whoever put it on TV should be immediately fired.The main character is annoying and not likable but also doesn't serve to make anyone laugh even once, it is just not a funny show or funny main character. The other characters also are not funny in the least.Also the guy playing the main Jeff character can't act worth garbage so that's another reason to cancel this travesty.Jeff Ltd is total garbage that could only make the worst and least intelligent people laugh.
