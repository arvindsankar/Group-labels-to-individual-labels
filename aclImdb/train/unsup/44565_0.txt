Bad, bad, bad. This film could be used as a torture device. Ithought Superman could save anything. Obviously not this movie. This movie was the Richard Pryor Movie, not about Superman. Since when was Superman a comedy and not an action/drama? Richard Pryor and poor script writing made this film absolutelyhorrible. It was very slow moving, and went nowhere. I wonderhow Warner Brother execs. approved this. I like Richard Pryor, buthe had no place in this movie. I thought Superman IV was wasworst Superman movie. I may have to re-think that now, afterhaving to endure watching this one again.
