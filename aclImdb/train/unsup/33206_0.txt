This film looked like it had the production budget of about 3 bags of weed. It almost looks like a student film. Bad lighting, bad soundtrack, bad plot, shallow characters and even badder acting.I laughed out aloud at some of the bad dialogue and the main character "Taylor" who was more concerned about flicking her long hair and looking sexy than actually trying to act.Given the obvious lack of funding, the badly written script and the amateur actors - the director than likely did the best they could - under the circumstances.But there are a lot better Slasher style pics out there which have been made on a similar budgets and still retain a good story with lots of good chills. The indie horror film "Malevolence" is a prime example.Wold Creek had a budget of $1 Million US - and it was one of the scariest and brutal films ever made in the slasher genre. Granted this was an amateur effort, but that's still no excuse. An original idea may have been all that was needed to elevate this film above the level of "absurd".
