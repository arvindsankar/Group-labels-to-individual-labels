This effort attempts to be humorous via sheer puerility but fails miserably.The reason for its failure is at least three-fold:1) No scriptwriters were employed during this production2) Actors with ability were deemed entirely unnecessary3) The advert for the sound man appeared in the "Deaf Times"It would be an affront to all films ever made (independent or otherwise, and including Gigli) to label this plotless effort as a "film"; this "attempt" is truly dreadful. I shiver when I recall the crass manner of "acting" in this "thing"; please do not make the same mistake I made in watching this.Waste no money, no time or even bandwidth on this!
