So you pay to subscribe to cable television, and you can't expect too much. Perhaps the odd decent movie and some classic reruns of your favourite old series... but overall, generally speaking you don't expect too much.I came across this movie late one night on cable, and began to watch. Interesting idea... two no hoping kids get an opportunity to go to Africa with some other no hoping political army to fight some war bla bla bla, let's see how we go (and if they get to go).To cut a long story short...Thirty minutes in, not much happening.An hour in, are they going or what?The organisers want five hundred from both of them... Let's go and mug people for the money! Why didn't I think of that earlier!Finally, the day before departure. Oh, I don't want to go anymore. What? I've killed someone to get this money! Still, I'm not going anymore, I said God damn it!Well my mate's not going, so I'll just jump in the Yarra and go for a swim.Is this movie supposed to have some hidden, subtle message? Is it supposed to be deep and complex? What the hell does this movie mean, if anything? Poor old Claudia Karvan... at least she makes an attempt to envoe some kind of meaning (just).So as I was saying, you don't expect too much from cable television movie channels, but you'd expect more than this!
