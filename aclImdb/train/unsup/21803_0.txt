+ three points for production values bigbrother with ghosts, kinda bad plot especially as the actors were basic teens... this movie could have been from dimension films... i didn't get scared... the ideas were that used. the use of bass, and mtv-style editing. sounds we're similar to everything you have seen before.nothing new... except that it's not made in California =D.the ghosts maybe scare kids, but to me a grown man whose seen a lot of crap, this movie made no impact.dull, boring, nothing new. another teen movie, with bass sounds with every scare =D
