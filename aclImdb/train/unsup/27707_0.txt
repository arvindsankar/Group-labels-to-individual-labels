This past summer, there was a frog that sat on my doorstep every night. Presumably he was there to eat the flies attracted by my porch light, I don't know. But he was there every night, and gone every morning. And he would sit there and stare. It was really quite eerie. That frog was more frightening than this movie.Let's face it: frogs just aren't that scary. The movie involves a wealthy family on an estate that get attacked and overrun by frogs. The filmmakers must have realized that little frogs, even in vast quantities, are not the terrible killers they wanted them to be, because they set them up more as the masterminds, urging alligators, snakes and scorpions to do most of their killing.The film had an even pace that kept building slowly to a rather fun but ridiculous ending, and some interesting scenes. It is rather dated though, in slang and fashion, and it just didn't do it for me.Overall, not a good film, but kind of fun in a watch once kind of way if you have nothing better to do.
