The good news is that it was on broadcast TV - I didn't pay anything.The better news is that I was doing something at the same time so I didn't waste any time on it.I like Alyson Hannigan. And this movie shows she is game for anything.There is an attractive blonde in a bikini.That gives it two stars.I'm straining to dredge up a third star. OK, the cat diarrhoea scene gets a star for sheer bizarreness.My final comment is a complaint about the 10 line rule, because I have read other reviews of less than 10 lines and, believe me, I've said enough.
