One of the common criticisms of Bette Davis is always that without a strong directorial hand she'd start chewing the scenery. But that also has saved some mediocre films and made them entertaining. Davis's strong personality comes through in the clinch.Here though I wish she had chewed some scenery, if she had the film might have become a camp classic. Instead it is unbelievably dull.Bette Davis is a poetess, a 20th century Emily Dickinson, who meets and falls in love with a war hero played by Jim Davis. Yes, that's right, Jim Davis who later became Jock Ewing. He's a navy veteran, a war hero, who is considering the priesthood as a vocation.But first before the curtain of celibacy falls, he wants to have a fling or two, so Jim is on the make for Bette and for the young Janis Paige. Bette wins out so they go to her late father's place in New England where they talk and talk and talk about all of their problems and the world's problems.When you have engaging and likable characters even a plot less movie is entertaining. The best example I know is The Sundowners. But there is absolutely nothing in this film that makes you care an iota about the people here. A little Davis histrionics might have saved this film, but we'll never know.John Hoyt has an interesting part. It's as though he's trying to be a poor man's Clifton Webb. We should have had more of him as well.
