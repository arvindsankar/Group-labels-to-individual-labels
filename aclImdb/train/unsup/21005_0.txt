This sequel is unworthy of Disney legend:First, the bonuses are a shame: no additional animation and only the choice to see the songs of the movie (what is the "scene selection" for then ?).Second, the animation is confused: some parts are good, other haven't even the level of the Saturday cartoons!Third, the story is too boring: if the end is rather enjoyable, it took maybe 40 long minutes to get there!So, what is left ? Only a good cast of characters: if the movie focuses maybe on the irritating Iago (the movie should have been titled "The Return of Iago!!!"), the gentle Genie is rather funny and Jasmine is one of the most beautiful Disney woman! OK, I feel a bias because my personal path crossed the one of a Arabian girl, and the two are really like twins, in their expressions as well as their charms!So, I guess I should rather look for the first one, to find more Jasmine (and nostalgia of my friend) & a better story !!!!!
