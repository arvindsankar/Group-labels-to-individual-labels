I like to MST3K this movie. Drives my roomie crazy. She takes Lifetime movies seriously.Totally a guilty pleasure movie. Cheesy and funny. What makes it even better is imagining SD rehearsing her lines, actually taking the job seriously--"What's my motivation? What would Lorie do?" Wm. Devane is not my idea of a sexy sexy older man for a younger girl--Powers Boothe woulda been totally good in that role. Or Craig T. Nelson. Or Bruce Boxleitner. Or any other members of the Male Lead Pantheon of Planet Lifetime.The whole daughter thing near the end came out of nowhere. I've got way too much time on my hands.
