My partner and I won tickets to see the Sydney sneak preview so off we went last night (Monday 16th October) Let me begin by saying 'that is 88 minutes of my life that I will never get back" I was set to see a great Aussie flick; instead I found it mind numbingly boring, predictable 'comedy' (and I use that term lightly) It was more of a reflection on a horde of has been 'comedians' (and I use that term lightly also) who have unceremoniously used their names and positions on radio stations around Australia to tout the movie as being the best thing since sliced bread Suggest you spend 88 minutes watching the grass grow than see this movie I think I would have enjoyed having my fingernails ripped off one by one followed by an acid bath more than that ghastly piece of 'Australian Film making'
