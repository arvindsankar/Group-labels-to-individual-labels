Worst Children's' film I have seen to date.I was thoroughly disappointed at this film. Not because of the quality, not the length. But at the material that ended up being this movie.I rented this expecting this to be a beloved "Disney" classic. But instead all I saw was an orchestra and a few snippets of cartoons. I would have no problem with solid cartoons, with classical music accompanying the drawings. But to showcase an orchestra, for almost the entire length of the film, is a bit much.If you are looking for a classic "Disney" movie, with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, etc. Avoid this one.I give it two thumbs down.
