I was expecting it to be a bit cheesy and low-budget-looking, but I wasn't expecting to be insulted.This "film" has similar production values and acting caliber as you will find in an average daytime soap.It's as if the crew of "Days of Our Lives" borrowed the studio's gear for a weekend and went and shot a "Sci-Fi/Thriller" because those are popular these days, so we should be able to make some cash with it.It wasn't scary, wasn't thrilling, wasn't even sci-fi-y, just boring and predictable. No plot, bad lighting, laughable critters, wooden acting, no reason at all to force yourself to sit through a turd like this one.The rave reviews here have to be from people associated with the production, or else who haven't actually seen the "film".Avoid at all cost.
