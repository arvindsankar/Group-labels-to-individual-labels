Has anyone noticed the similarity of Grady to Shangri-La?The airplane crash brings Conway to the lamasary of Shangri-La; a car smash brings Ben Stone to Grady.Both find a world in which they can function apart from their 'chosen' capitalistic professions.Unlike 'Witness', 'Doc Hollywood' does what we all would: find that entrance to Shangi-La and never look back! Who, even a Yankee, could leave Grady? Who, even an Englishman could leave Shangri-La?A great movie! -30-
