What a loser this 1998 film is.It's a shame that Signe Hasso, a great actress so many years ago, allowed herself to get into this productive mess. I want to remember Signe Hasso for "The House on 92nd Street," not this mess of a film.For Rob Lowe, the film is perfect. He lacks talent and this picture allows him to display it.One of the previous comments says that Michael York is similar to the late James Mason. Is that true and I congratulate the writer for stating this.Cassie was just too sweet of a girl to be left alone here. Go know that she led a previous life which is true of the Lowe and Hasso characters.Ms. La Rue is no Lola. That's what was needed for her part as well as far better writing. The film appears amateurish at times.
