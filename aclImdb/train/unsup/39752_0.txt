This was a very odd movie, it was a mix between Movie and porn.It was most likely Steven Baldwins worst film, I also noticed that One time Bond star George Lazenby had a small part in the film, I thought he did really well considering the type of movie it is.This is a movie that you could watch if you had Absulutely nothing else to watch, thats why I watched it.There where some very nice nude scenes however.Stephen Baldwin, What the hell are you doing? You use to do quality films, fire that agent of yours.go to your local video shop and you'll find this movie in the B-grade waste of time section, it should be right next to Gladiator or some other crappy Russel Crowe Movie.
