I would compare this film with a painful root canal I once had...but I wouldn't want to insult my dentist.I base my opinion on the following...the film contains:- bad acting (and to wit; bad casting) - bad writing - bad camera work - bad directing - bad editingand BAD accents. I noticed Catherine Charlton was listed as the dialogue coach. she also worked with Angelina Jolie on a number of films. this explains a lot.if forced to say something nice, I'd have to say that there are nice horsies in the film. yay for nice horsies!the director of this film, Reverge Anselm, also wrote and directed the execrable "Stateside". I'd appreciate it if he would never be involved in making a film ever again.
