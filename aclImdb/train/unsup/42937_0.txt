This latest entry into straight-to-TV videos sees Tom Skerrit running for his life when disaster hits New York City. Another predictable, pretentious natural disaster "thriller" made for TV, "Earthquake in New York" does nothing we have not seen before, and accomplishes zip.Boring from start to finish.1.5/5 stars -John Ulmer
