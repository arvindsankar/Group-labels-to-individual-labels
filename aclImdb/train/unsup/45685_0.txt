This movie is terrible. Not the kind of terrible that's charming and funny.. its the kind of terrible in where you throw your copy of the DVD away.The story is incomprehensible, and seems as though it were 2 movies spliced together. The emotional soul searching that our hero goes on, takes up 2/3s of the movie and is painfully uninteresting to watch.And the fight scenes. I dont know what the other people on here are thinking (they liked this?)but when you have a scene of 20+ people fighting.. you dont zoom in!! In all of the fights, they use close ups, and shake the camera to create drama? All you see is fists flying past the lens, and terrible sound effects to go along with it.I give this movie a 1/10 and declare it UNWATCHABLE.
