Well, my vote says it all...I read the book as a child, well, I listened and my parents read it to me... And it was a great, moving and touching story.But the Dutch movie-industry did the same to it as what they have done with Floris the TV series , they made an awful movie out of it.I hate it because: -The plot was changed -important characters were cut out -every excitement was banned -they even put a 15th century armour on the one of the villains...I loved the artwork at the end of the movie.Please, Please, Please never F****ck up a good story again, Dutch filmmakers.....Now they are working on making a movie of "Brief aan de Koning" (Letter to the King) - another great book about a boy who got a mission, just on the evening before he would be knighted....I hope Pieter Verhoef will make a decent movie for a change.
