One of my favourite movies of all time. It's a lovely bitter-sweet story surrounded by an edgy plot and plenty of action and bits of humour.The story tells of the ancient partnership of a ghost and a human teaming together to solve cases concerning unhappy ghosts.But with this ancient partnership, comes a burden.This movie does carry on a tiny bit but it's all for the sake of emotional suspense.The plot twists and turns and just when you think you can predict it... I haven't met a single person that hasn't enjoyed it (and I've played this film to a lot of friends)Perfect for a night in, maybe with your other half, it's neither overly violence nor over-mushy.I can't hyper about this movie enough!
