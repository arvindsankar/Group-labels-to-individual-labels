Paraphrasing from Mark Twain's foreword in the book Huckleberry Finn, "Anyone trying to find a Plot in this, will be Hung. Anyone trying to find a moral will be shot." This movie is meant to be enjoyed and not Figured out.Surf 2, the end of the Trilogy was always playing at my house. This is one of my favorite movies. I like listening to this movie even if I am not in the room. I used to watch this movie and then play it again.I compare this movie to Cheech and Chong and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I love this movie because of the dialog. Every line makes me laugh. Everything that is said is really silly. It's a slap stick kind of humor. I was 14 when this movie came out. So I could relate to being a teenager, partying, girls, and just being silly.Some of my favorite lines are"One time I was surfing this 50 foot tidal wave, and what appears beside me?" "I don't know? What?" "What you mean you don't know? You were there beside me." "I know, but I love to hear you tell it.""What's that noise?" "It's the beach. never mind" "It's a Great White."I could go on and on, but this is one of the best Unknown movies. If you like this, be sure to watch "The Search for One Eye Jimmy"
