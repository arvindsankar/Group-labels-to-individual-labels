I watched this on TV at Christmas time and really enjoyed it. It's good family entertainment, thought the sword fights were great.Really liked Susie Amy as Valentine, think she was good for the role, and Marcus Jean Pirae was good as well as Villeroi.It wasn't brilliantly written, it was a bit 'storytelling' but the cast was great - Gerard Depardiu didn't do very much though - it seemed as though he was drunk from time to time! The villages and the sets were beautiful and really perfect for the period. It was great to see Michael York back as D'Artagnan!I would recommend this for adults and children, it's an adventure...
