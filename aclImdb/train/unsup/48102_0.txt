Tony Parker: Well, actually, I'm a bisexual lesbian in a man's body... but it's more complicated than that.Now this is an Eddie Izzard moving worth watching. Not a great film, mind you, but a bit funny.Izzard was precious as tony parker. i can't get the image of Joey out of my mind when I see Matt LeBlanc, so seeing him as the tough guy was a bit odd.Nicolette Krebitz was actually the best actor in the film.No one does a British Officer better than Edward Fox (Ghandi, A Bridge Too far)
