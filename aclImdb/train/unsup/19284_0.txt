Wish this great film had made it to the Big Screen! Absolutely the best film ever made on Teddy Rosevelt.Great for the whole family in my opinion!It not only documents his life... it also presents his great ideals and character as very 'Presidential' and to be desired. The same cannot be said of all our Presidents.The depiction of the battle for San Quan Hill was one of the best war documentaries I've ever seen.An all-star cast helps make this a classic movie.I will get this movie for my collection for sure.I will recommend it to all our family and friends.-BGLewis of Spring Hill, FL
