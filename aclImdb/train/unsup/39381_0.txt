The question you have to ask yourself after sitting through this turgid piece of utterly uninspired cinema is "why did they bother?"Nothing more than a series of clich√©d set pieces and more ham than a spit-roasted hog. Even The League of Gentlemen's usually excellent Steve Pemberton notches up a performance as excruciating as Lenny Henry doing Frank Spencer.Maybe I'm getting carried away, after all it is for kids, but even when compared to the Elizabeth Taylor Lassie films this just doesn't cut it. A lazy effort all round. The dog out performs everyone, including Peter O'Toole.Save your money and wait until it's released on DVD. It'll just about look OK on the small screen, maybe.
