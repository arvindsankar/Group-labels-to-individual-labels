This first screenplay by Robert Desiderio is very commendable,He is from TV & so are all of the other actors.Judith Light & Stephen Lang are devout Christians, They run Genesis House, a home to help homosexuals be saved by the love of Jesus. A few years back her own son killed himself because he was gay, & this one of the reasons they run Genesis House, We are concerned with 2 of the guys. Robert Gant (he was Ben in Queer as Folk) & Chad Allen (many TV shows) Judith Light & Stephen Lang are TV Veterans of many years,Miss Lights role is not that of a bigot,it is one of a devout Christian misguided but definitely not a true bigot.This excellent performance & the roles done by Allen & Gant, make this a love story to be seen & discussed.It does have many clich√©s as one would expect, they are well handledThis is another film made in New Mexico & the scenery is superb.It had a few month run in only a handful of theatres this fall.It should of had a better run.There is only one very short sex scene at the beginning & a few uses of the 'F' word.I recommend SAVE MR for lovers of good love stories.I am glad I saw this film.Ratings *** (out of 4) 87points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
