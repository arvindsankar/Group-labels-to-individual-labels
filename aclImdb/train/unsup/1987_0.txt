I like the relation ship between de main characters, is a way to show lovebetween two people, in this case, men Is a hard love story, but very human, very sensitive You can feel pain. the actors are terrific, did they win an award, because they deserved one. I didn't like the voice over at the beginning, we don't need itThe soundtrack is very smart, I loved the moment when The "nene" speaks thevoice over and we can hear Billy Holiday. Good direction good art Thank you!
