OK. This seems to be a documentary about a film crew going to MN to film a "mysterious" hole in the ice. But the hole is closed so the crew does some soul-searching as they explore the hole, its meaning, its possible causes, ....It's an Indie film so it's not superficial cr*p. No, it's heavy and serious and meaningful and fresh and vibrant and significant.And it's really a mocumentary. Wow. So many layers.What really really happens is New Journalism || New Film-making: It's not about the subject - the hole in the ice - it's about the director's feelings about himself as he confronts the not-hole.Wow. You know, like Maureen Dowd's articles are not about the subject but about how she feels about the subject.Since this is about Karpovsky we see that he's got some problems with his woman at home, with his camera crew, with friends. He talks to the camera from a bathroom; he talks on his mobile. He begins to question his existence; the meaning of life; god. Wow. It's really heavy.Then he checks into a mental hospital and we go through that with him.So it could have been an interesting story. But Karpovsky's real and/ or imagined problems aren't interesting.Wow. You just don't know what's real and what's not. Wow.There is nothing in this film: no creativity, no humor, no insight, nothing nada. See it if you want to hear a whining & uninteresting guy crying and talking about himself.But, hey, it's an Indie. Wow.
