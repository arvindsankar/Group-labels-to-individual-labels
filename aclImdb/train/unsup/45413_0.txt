This was about as much fun as sticking pins in your eyes.This transcends the "so bad it's good" genre so completely that it has created a new "so bad I'd rather be tortured by the Stasi" categorisation. The real monster in this film is the director/writer. Script: 0 Terrible. No redeeming features whatsoever.Acting: 0 Appalling. I kept shouting "Quick! Use acting." in the vain hope that someone would.Plot: 0 Dreadful. More holes than swiss cheese. Trying to set them out wastes valuable time that could be enjoyed NOT watching this film.Special effects: -58 Rule one of low budget monster movies is "don't show the monster". This film bravely ignores this and instead parades its terrible monster for about half the film. You laugh the first time and then it is an exercise in cringing as you realise you are supposed to be frightened of this thing.This is the first film that has made me wish IMDb allowed negative ratings. If you never watch this, it will be too soon.
