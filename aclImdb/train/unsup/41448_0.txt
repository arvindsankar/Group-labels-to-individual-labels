Not sure how this movie is at a 7.5/10 at the moment. My guess is all 11 voters have worked on the project.And the first person to comment on this movie is talking about a Horror movie. Well, there is nothing horror about it - besides the camera work and acting that is.It's basically a Thriller, with some small sci-fi elements (in the story, not special effects).The beginning is fine, and opens a lot of possibilities for a good movie, but it never gets better, only worse.Avoid this movie when you can.
