I'm sure it has been said a million times but this was one of the most powerful depictions I've ever watched on this kind of topic. At a technical level the film workedÂ—just the right touch of techniques, not overboard. I love the way the director connected the story elements rather than use the same old flashback technique some films use. The story moved at a tight pace, but not so fast you can't absorb its impact. I felt like someone grabbed my insides and said "Don't move, we are going for the ride of your life!" There is no comparison between this film and a movie like How She Move. I really hope it becomes one of the landmark pieces on this issue. Kudos! Maureen
