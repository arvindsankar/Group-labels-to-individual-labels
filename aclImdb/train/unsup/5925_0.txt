When writing or directing a children's film, far too oftenpeople find it necessary to dumb down work in order to cater toa young audience. Fortunately this is not the case with TheSecret Garden, a film in which the story it presents is wellcrafted and intelligent, and appealing to both young and oldaudiences. In many ways the production could have gonedreadfully wrong. One can see where in the hands of a lesstalented writer or director the story could have becomemelodramatic, overly sentimental, or comical, yet The SecretGarden is a beautifully executed picture that rings true as aresult of its naturalistic storytelling. Much of this is due tothe credit of its fine cast. Frequently, child actors areemployed to act "cute" onscreen, but there is not a young actorin this movie who does not give a performance of great depth. Infact, it can easily be argued that each one of these childrenexhibit greater skill than many adults currently working in therealm of cinema. But what is at the heart of The Secret Gardenis a beautiful lyrical story about love, childhood, growth, andhealing. There are moments in the film that are so genuinelytouching the viewer's heart almost stops. Such is the case ofthe scene in which the bedridden Collin is escorted outside ofhis house and his eyes open to see spread before him hismother's beautiful garden. No line of dialogue is necessary, forthe happiness and peace that appears on Collin's face speakvolumes in regard to his character. The film's ending emotion is so rich and moving that it isimpossible for the filmgoer to sit untouched. This story is anabsolute delight, and should be a must for
