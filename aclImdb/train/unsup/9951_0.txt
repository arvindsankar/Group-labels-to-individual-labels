Just like in " Romeo and Juliet " Olivia Hussey takes place in front of us. She makes all the difference. An extraordinary actress with a very special beauty takes this classical movie and place it very, very high...The music, the scenery- and the acting... It all ends up in this beautiful movie. Sadness. Frustration and a lot of love.You got to love it...
