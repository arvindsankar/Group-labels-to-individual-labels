Someone wakes me up when something starts happening. Otherthan Kathryn Witt's form fitting 80's jeans I see no reason to botherwith this stinker. Seems to have been fashioned as an excuse toshoot a bunch of footage with one of those helicopter enginepontoon swamp boats & discussion scenes at a Hawaiian touristresort during an off-season winter lull. I also love how thehero/heroine are thrown out of the resort one scene & the nextthey go back to have a drink. THEN they get thrown out again, andare back four scenes later since that was the best set they had.I love low budget horror trash as much as anyone else, butsomething ought to happen every once in a while, and if you aregoing to have an attractive woman play a herpatologist in a horrorfilm she had better be seen at least topless & getting far more outof her career than she bargained on, or you have blown it.As for the monster suit, heh, I thought it was kind of fun to seesomeone not even bother to make something that looked "realistic" -- Kind of like Lamberto Bava's MONSTER SHARK, butwithout any point to it & lacking that movie's ridiculousentertainment value.Best line: "It takes two to mate."
