in very simple words the worst computer animated movie of all time it was horrible beyond imagination it should be given a rating of R so that no child has to endure the pain of watching this movieonly 3 things happened!!the opening scene, the baseball scene and the alien sceneIt was so pathetic, this as to be Disney's lowest point. the funny thing is that they expected to receive 350 million for this movieWatching this makes me the wonder what happened to the good old animated films
