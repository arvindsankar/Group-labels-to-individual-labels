Some quotes from friends of mine about the TV series "Hex":'Pretentious sub-Buffy twaddle.''"Hollyoaks" for Goths.''Moody, dark, impenetrably pointless.''As scary as a balloon on a stick.''Too mediocre to qualify for a "So Bad It's Good" badge.''Clearly written for teenagers by marketing men and seedy hacks in cardigans.''Money back, don't want.' 'Takes itself far too seriously.''Bad, bad, bad. Just really bad.''Like "Angel" but without the plot, the jokes or the acting talent.''A ghost train ride with the power switched off.''Makes me ashamed to be British.''Makes "Charmed" look like it was written by Chekov.''I'd rather watch fabric conditioner commercials back-to-back than another episode of "Hex".'So there you go. I couldn't find anyone who watched this miserable TV series who had a good word to say about it. Mind you, I'm 39 and most of my friends are of a similar age. There must be a lot of sullen teenage Goths out there who liked "Hex" enough for it to have such a high IMDb rating.
