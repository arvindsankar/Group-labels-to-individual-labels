This show is by no means "great" or sweeping in its view. It isn't groundbreaking or original. But, where there are cons, there are pros.Pros: Solid writing, twisty plots, good suspense, solid character builds, and it has a knack for being funny and entertaining. I have never seen an episode that wasn't decent. That say's something about quality.Cons: Sometimes the plots can be derivative or questionable, never really gets edgy, characters, though well drawn, never get out of place. Can at times be a bit mundane.But, overall, I am sorry I put this show off for four years. It is usually entertaining.Recommended.
