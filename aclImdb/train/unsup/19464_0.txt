Entertaining and intelligent story behind this Latino legend.Great film-making also! I definitely recommend this film.It stayed clear of silly stereotypes.The story was interesting.The directing and acting was great.Looks like a big budget film, even though it wasn't a Hollywood film.It jumps into interesting cultural issues.And the director and writers isn't afraid to bringing up societal taboos. A must see.I grew up with the legend.It scared me then.This movie also scares me.
