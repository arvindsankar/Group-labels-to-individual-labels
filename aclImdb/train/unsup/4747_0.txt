Benjamin Barry is an advertising executive and ladies' man who, to win a big campaign, bets that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. Andie Anderson covers the "How To" beat for "Composure" magazine and is assigned to write an article on "How to Lose a Guy in 10 days." They are sure to meet each other in a bar and both tries to get what they want without knowing what they are really doing.This is one of the funnier romantic comedies, if you'd like some laughs. There are many laugh-out-loud moments here and there. The humor was witty and slapstick, which I love in comedies.The chemistry between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey is great. this film is like the battle of the sexes.Don't watch this film if you want lies between romance but if you would like to have a really good time, then this is the film.
