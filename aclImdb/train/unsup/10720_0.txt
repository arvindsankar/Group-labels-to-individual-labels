Forget the other comments above. This movie is great, especially if you have ever been involved with any musical theatre in your life.This young troop of actors did an outstanding job, and I guarantee that at least four of them will go on to huge careers. Tiffany Taylor, Daniel Letterle especially turned out wonderful performances. It's been playing quite often on WAM and I find myself sitting through it every time it's on. I have yet to get tired of this movie. The musical numbers were fantastic!I get chills watching Tiffany Taylor sing "Here's Where I Stand" near the end of the film. And if you aren't moved by the drag party the campers hold for Michael, you're just dead inside. Dead I say.
