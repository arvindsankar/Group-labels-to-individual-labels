This is without a doubt the worst film I've seen since Boxing Helena. It really is that bad.I can only begin to imagine why it has a decent IMDb score (friends and family of the film-makers?). I cannot imagine anybody enjoying this film, so banal is the script and so lacking is the plot.After (roughly) the 20 minute mark, the film has become so utterly, irredeemably rubbish that one is forced to consider whether it is intentional and intended as a form of challenging art rather than as a linear film.Terrible, terrible film.Avoid like the plague.
