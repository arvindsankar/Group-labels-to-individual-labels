Watching this film reminded me of an afternoon sitcom, the actor's did without a doubt, it just has "done on the cheap" written all over it.it claims to be about the person that the movies "Exorcist" is about, but I found nothing of the such to back up that claim at all, so thats the production company blagging away there.It's a shame really, as I'm a fan of the genre, but this has "Made for Teens" all over it.Shame really because it could have been good, especially when you remember that the original Exorcist wasn't released here in the UK for fourteen years!
