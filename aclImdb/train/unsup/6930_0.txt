One of the worst movies I've ever rented. Sorry it had one of my favorite actors on it (Travolta) in a nonsense role. In fact, anything made sense in this movie.Who can say there was true love between Eddy and Maureen? Don't you remember the beginning of the movie ?Is she so lovely? Ask her daughters. I don't think so.
