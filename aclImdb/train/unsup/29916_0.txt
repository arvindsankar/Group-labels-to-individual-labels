Exciting, suspenseful and tightly woven suspense drama.Cher proves she can ACT.You probably will not immediately recognize Liam Neeson in the role of the deaf, mute, shell-shocked Carl Wayne Anderson.For someone that does not speak for the entire film he turns in a stellar performance.Dennis Quaid is very good as the juror that steps outside his assigned duties as a juror and becomes a detective.Also John Mahoney is almost unrecognizable as Judge Matthew Helms -- a polar opposite from his "Frasier" character.When I spoke to Tom Barbour (Justice Lowell in this film, stage actor and the father of Dudley Moore in the "Arthur" movies) he said when he got the script he was thrilled -- the film opens with him, it took place in his office, he had every other line, and then on page three -- well I guess you will just have to see it.Surprise ending goes right up to the last couple of minutes -- prepare to be shocked.
