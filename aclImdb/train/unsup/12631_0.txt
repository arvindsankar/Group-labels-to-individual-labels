This film was a real snooze-fest interrupted by brief flashes of action. In fact, most of the action took place at the beginning and the end. You could skip the whole middle.Dolph Lundgren sure didn't show the action hero we saw in The Punisher or Universal Soldier as a demolitions expert in taking apart land mines.Claire Stansfield was equally flat as the woman who recruited him to help rid Angola of a new type of mine.Someone even compared Lungren to Commando Arnold. What a joke!I imagine that there is a market for movies like this in foreign countries.
