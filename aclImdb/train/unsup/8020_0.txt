I enjoyed this movie, very much. I keep expecting certain things and never got them. This was a very original film, not at all what I expected.Adrian Paul was terrific. His character when from shy to aggressive in the blink of an eye. After seeing him in the Highlander movies and series this was certainly a change.I loved this movie!
