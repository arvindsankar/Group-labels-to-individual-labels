Comment #55The SharkTank Redemption is a satire of The Shawshank Redemption that is included on the 2-disc Collector's Edition DVD of the latter-mentioned film. This 25-minute film is good for a lot of laughs and is highly enjoyable.Fred Redding (Alfonso Freeman) is an assistant at the Hollywood agency CMA, and he is seeking a promotion. He is denied, and is miserable because of that and because of his crappy cubicle job. However, he befriends the new guy at the office, Randy Tulane (Steven Amato), and finds new meaning in life with his friend.The movie is hilarious as it is, but it could be funnier. I'm satisfied with it, as most of the funny parts are on the brink of or are hysterical. Most of the humor involves Fred's and Randy's boss having fits and almost insane.The SharkTank Redemption is a very refreshing satire of a classic masterpiece, and is definitely worth seeing. Some scenes could have used some changing, but I guarantee you will be laughing the whole way through, as I was.8/10
