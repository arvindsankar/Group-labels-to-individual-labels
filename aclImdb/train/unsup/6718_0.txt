I went to this movie with my family last week. I was told by a friend that it was great, and I have always been a fan of movies like Toy Story, Bugs Life, etc.I am also a fan of Jerry Seinfeld, so I really had some expectations good expectations for this movie.This move was funny in a few places and started out stronger than it ended. In fact the last 30 minutes are painful to sit through.The sad part is that they took a great idea, and a strong opening and lost it in silly court room scenes that weren't funny, a Rose Bowl heist that was made no sense, and ended with nothing more than a political message on living green.It is evident that this is not an "A" movie, or even a "B" movie. I would say that it is like a "C-" to "D+" movie at best.Save your money and rent it, watch the first 45 minutes, then call it a day.
