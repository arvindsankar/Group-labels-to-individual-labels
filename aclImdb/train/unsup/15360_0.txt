This movie really made me laugh, I loved the flavor, the "ambiance" of the movie, I was really there in Paris in the 60's. Some of the dialog are really funny especially the ones from aurelian vick and alice taglionie, some parts are very sexy. The music is amazing, I will get the soundtrack.The photo is also very nice, this movie remained me the spirit of the 60's, how the teens were at the time.The rock and roll attitude of the character is funny, the way they talk to each other, they way they danced. I recommend you to watch this, it brings you back in time
