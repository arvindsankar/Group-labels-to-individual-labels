I give it a three. This movie is very unoriginal.Spoiler alert.The supposedly artistic scenes are unoriginal and seem like they are supposed to freak you out, but makes you yawn. Bodies struggling behind a sheet of plastic has been done over and over. Many unoriginal aspects in this movie.I am not drawn into the characters. It does not make me actually care what happened to Hanna.Vince Canlas's (Cain) acting was especially bad. Oz's last scene was really corny.What's that? You meet your sweetheart in heaven in the end? Yawn.Couple good things: Nathan Mobley's(Samuel North) acting wasn't bad.The scene in the junk yard: The actor that plays the first body out of the hearse looks like Johnny Depp. Yum.
