This is one of the worst Stephen King movies I've ever seen. This is not the only Stephen King movie that is bad. There are several others. I have never read the book and I probably never will.*Spoiler Alert* The movie revolves around a scientist named Dr. Lawrence Angelo(Pierce Brosnan) who uses virtual reality to try and increase the intelligence in chimpanzees. Then he sees Jobe Smith(Jeff Fahey), a mentally retarded man and gets an idea. He decides to try an experiment to see if he can make Jobe smarter. He succeeds. When Jobe gets smart enough, he decides to go on a killing spree and kill all those who have wronged him and kills anyone that stands in his way.There were a few problems with this movie: 1. Jobe has become a genius, he has a hot blond girlfriend who loves him, can now read minds, has the telekinesis ability, and he is angry because some guy called him retarded? 2. Why does Jobe goes on a killing spree? Surely, if Jobe was a genius, he must have figured out that killing people is not the answer. So why does he just kill everybody? 3. Why does Jobe want power? Why doesn't he just use his knowledge for good and benefit mankind? 4. How and why does Jobe get transferred into the computer? What does he plan to accomplish now that he controls everything that is electronic? *End Spoiler* Overall, it's a stupid movie. Skip this one.I give it 1 star out of 10. This movie makes no sense!
