This must be one of the funniest movies ever made. Everything about it is so stupid. The acting is hilarious. The protagonists have no idea what they are doing or saying. The dialogs don't mean nothing. The example:- "they stroke here, here and here...do you see a pattern?"- "no"- "it's something we learned about the marabantu, they move clockwise in 30Â° angles" - "you mean we're next?" - "yes" - "how much time do we have?" - "24h, probably less...we have to kill their queen!""you mean we're next?" ...hahaha if that isn't hilarious I don't know what is. The action scenes are even worse. The ants are so un-scary. A bunch of little black plastic dots moving like Parkinson patients. The plot is....HAHAHAHAHAHA. Especially the scene where suddenly there is some kind of earthquake and then they blow up the pass. What the fck was that. If only there was a DVD release or a sequel.1/10 as a horror flick 9/10 as a comedy
