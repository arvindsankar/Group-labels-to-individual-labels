I came across an article on the BBC World News website for Friday Oct 28, 2005 discussing the IBM supercomputer Blue Gene/L. The machine, at the US Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, officially became the most powerful computer on the planet in June, 2005.Hmm #1: The computer has recently doubled its processing speed. "Blue Gene's performance, while it has been under construction, has quadrupled in just 12 months."Hmm #2: "The completed Blue Gene/L joins another supercomputing team-mate, called ASC Purple, to get to work on safeguarding the US's nuclear stockpile." Hmm #3 "Purple can do 100 teraflops while it carries out simulations of nuclear weapons performance."While they keep it on their site, you can read the full article at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4386404.stm "Supercomputer doubles own record".See the movie again.
