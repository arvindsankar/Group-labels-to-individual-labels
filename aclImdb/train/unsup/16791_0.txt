This one had more and better action then the first 2, and better acting and plot.The bad guys were cool, and I liked the way everything was done in this. There was better characters, not to mention more then in the first.This time, Soldier used a shotgun. Excellent choice for using against a bunch of evil bikers. The special effects seemed ok, and the action sequences were great. this was obviously done on a bigger budget then the first one, and I think they tried harder to make this then they did in the inferior predicessors.I honestly think they should remake the SnakeEater movies.I give SnakeEater III an 8 out of 10
