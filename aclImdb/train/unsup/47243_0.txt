The Black Dahlia turned out to be even worse than I imagined it could be. Had it not been for the lovely date I had, I would have been angry.The Black Dahlia is twenty-first century film noir. It is miraculous all the actors made it through the filming without lung cancer. I've never seen more people smoke in one film.Josh Hartnett is just too boyish looking to pull of the role he played. He is miscast.Aaron Eckhart is guilty of over acting and over acting, over and over.Scarlet Johanson seemed to act very little and I feel she was miscast as well.The brightest spot, in a long, tedious trudge, is Hilary Swank. She is cast to perfection and portrays the nefarious Madeleine, deliciously.Alas, the poor Mia Kirshner. Her performance of Elizabeth Short is so forgettable, it may work in her favor.According to IMDb, the budget was $50,000,000. If I had my druthers, I would have rather seen 10 $5,000,000 independent art house movies.The Black Dahlia appears to be another example of the Hollywood suits' inability to invest huge sums of money intelligently. I suppose next it will be "The Return of the Black Dahlia".
