This is a fantastic movie.I used to think it was too loud, abrasive and most certainly claustrophobic....and at that time it really turned me off. Well, it is all those things...but, it is brilliantly acted by both Segal and Streisand. I don't think I have seen Streisand more natural or convincing than in this role....and in my opinion she's extremely sexy.Originally I faulted George Segal for being so annoying (as Felix)...now, I applaud him for acting the part.There are some hysterically funny lines and situations in this movie.Enjoy
