For many viewers this film was spoilt by advertising, that showed a movie full of spying, hacking and big mysteries.Yes. Big mysteries.Left is one. How does a pretty smart guy lose contact to the "Reality", whatever that is meant? It is good, that this movie only had a low budget, that makes it possible to recognize the smallest change in acting.Simple plot, overwhelming acting, financial flop, just a terrific film.Thumbs up and 10 points
