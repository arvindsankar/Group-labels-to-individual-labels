Is there a worst comedy ever? oh yes in Bollywood we have many but this is one of the worst films ever madeThe film has a decent plot but it's ruined with stupid scenes like Sunny going towards the heroine and his mom Sikri getting fits in IndiaEven the skin show is forced and then the game of Sunny to play Behaal Singh is worst and even Romeo comes across as a stupid idiot The film makes no sense and is a example of mediocrityThere are several scenes which are so stupid and also the entire track of the FBI suddenly wanting to kill the president is awful and so is the finaleDirection by Rahul Rawail is terrible, it makes even YODHA look a classic Music is badSunny Deol is himself, funny in some comic scenes and over the top in some and too loud in several portions but he manages to lend some credibility to his character- 6/10 The girls Shilpi Mudgal and Nupur Mehta are bad Kamaal Khan is a joke as the main villainArun Bakshi is okay, Surekha Sikri is hilarious
