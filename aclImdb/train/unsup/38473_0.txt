I adore all other versions of Charles Addams' creations. But this one is the worst. Hearing what others had to say, I told myself that a movie can't be that bad. Well, I was right. It was worse.Tim Curry is a great actor. As long as he isn't Gomez.Daryl Hannah, I won't get into it. She was trying too hard to be as good as Anjelica Huston in the role.Nicole Fugere was decent in "The New Addams Family." Nicole and Alice Ghostly (Grandmama) were the only two characters who didn't make me want to kill them.All in all, not a bad movie if you like to make fun of a movie while you watch it.
