this is your typical teen movie...there's just nothing great about this.it's not scary either. the hanging body in the beginning didn't scare me at all. it seemed rather pretentious... and very predictable.then nothing happens in a long time. the movie just lags..the nerdy girl isn't particularly interesting.tomie is kinda hot, but she doesn't show her tits in this flick... =D=D=D i guess i've seen worse, but i would skip this one... don't rent it....
