I had no idea what this movie was, or what it was about when I first picked it up, but I found myself sucked into it quite quickly.This review may contain slight spoilers, but if you've seen a romantic comedy before, you'll know the outset.At first glance, it's a fairly stock-standard romantic comedy about an adult class in Korea being taught english by Cathy (Australian Angela Kelly) for various reasons (business, family, overseas trips), but as you see more there are a few things that set this film apart from its competition.My main gripe with this movie would be that the characters seem to change their attitudes and feelings on a dime. The obvious love between the two main characters 'Candy' Yeong-ju (Na-yeong Lee) and 'Elvis' Moon-su (Hyuk Jang, playing a very different role than from his efforts in Volcano High) seems to start too slow and then bullet ahead just in time for the end credits.Despite the comedy, this film does have some extremely touching moments, and I did feel for most of the characters with the possible exception of Cathy. Most noticably with Moon-su's side-story of a sister that was adopted and moved to America at a very young age.All in all, it's a nice and pleasant film. I found myself laughing out loud in more than one scene which is rare for me. Also look out for cameos from some better known Korean actors, such as the man on the train with the newspaper.6.5/10
