If you have any interest whatsoever in lesbian lives as they really have been and still are lived this is THE documentary to see.No doubt that we have to salute those women who "dared" to show their faces on screen in this documentary; it's not anything we are used to at least not outside the North America.Even though the woman portraited are, of course, living in North America it is still a fabulous documentary, actually quite breathtaking in all its "naturalness".Also spiced with a bit of "filmic erotica" I feel is it a necessity to watch for any lesbian woman.Bravo to those who came up with the idea and bravo for the woman who dared all along!
