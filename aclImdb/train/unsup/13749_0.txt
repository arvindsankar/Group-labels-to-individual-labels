This movie was thrown together without any attention to story line.It was a sorry excuse for cinema with no surprises and no excuse to be made in the first place.The slashing and thrashing scenes were dreadfully predictable and this movie is void of any merit. It was an independent effort that should not have been made.I liked the premise of making fun of reality shows but in turn, the movie gave us less cinema and drama than most reality shows in the first place. Somehow it achieved the best promotion for reality TV I've ever seen.Mike Wagner
