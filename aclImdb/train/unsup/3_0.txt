Not very many movies come to my mind that covered as much geography as this one.Naturally, being a Hollywood product, there is not a whole lot of realism here, but there is a whole lot of entertainment, and a whole lot of talent.Louis Wollheim apparently never became a household name, but his performance in this film would indicate he should have.In one priceless scene, when, without inter-titles, the Bill Boyd character whispers the explanation of a word (often found in the Bible), Wollheim's expression almost makes the whole movie worthwhile.Lewis Milestone's direction is another plus. This was still early in his career, but his use of inventive angles and a moving camera showed brilliance.Ian Keith made a superb suave villain in one of his best roles.Being a silent film, "Two Arabian Knights" probably won't be shown even on Turner Classic Movies very often, but I urge film fans to grab any opportunity to watch it.
