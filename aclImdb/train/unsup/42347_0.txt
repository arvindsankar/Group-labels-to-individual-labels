The producers of this crap owe the horror fans a BIG apology.There's no way they could have been serious. This was a sorry excuse for a comedy. They tried gore for no reason other than they knew the joke was flat.This gets one star for the idea, and another for the concert scenes. Even though the music was worse than anything I could think of.Deaths follow a metal band on tour.Did they do it? Will you care? No!!! Put it back and rent something else.
