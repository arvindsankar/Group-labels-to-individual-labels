Worst Henry VIII as he looks nothing like himCostumes, excellent,Sets,excellent . Many historical errors.We are "Tudor" fans and would prefer more accuracy over the blatant pornography.I know you do not like criticism, but someone has to face reality in writing We were hoping for a real good historical story with good writing , and accuracy.That whole episode about the sisters of Henry VIII , Margaret & Mary was pitiful
