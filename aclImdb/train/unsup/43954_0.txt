First off, if someone would go out of his way to such an extend as the main character Veil in Freeze Frame to get himself a life supply of alibi, wouldn't it be a lot easier to just plant a chip somewhere in his arse? Without going into the elaborate details of such a plant; Yes! it would! (And with the famous words of Frederick Forrest in Falling Down: "Think about it!")So much for the premise...What have we got left then? Let's see. We are stuck with a flick in which truly horrible acting is a virtue leaving no exceptions. Besides the premise we get served a storyline which has been done better in any average episode of Scooby Doo and we get to see an ending which has been done better in any lesser episode of Scooby Doo. I'm not kidding nor am I exaggerating!Didn't this movie have any redeeming qualities at all? yes it did, it ended at some point.If it wasn't for the plot, one would think he was watching a children's-picture. It all fits: the deranged bad guy, the crooked detective and his nutty aid and the female reporter! Even the cardboard acting would in that case work as children wouldn't mind overplayed stereotypes. They love it!To list all the implausibility's in this movie would require me to see it again and take notes scene by scene. As u no doubt have guessed, I'm not going to.If it wasn't so painful to watch, it might have been good for a laugh or two.0/10
