This is my first review as I felt compelled to write to say just how bad this film is.The acting is awful. The direction is awful and this type of storyline has been done to death.What was Christian Slater thinking ? I always watch films to the end of the titles but I was sooo glad when the, "Action", finished, I couldn't bear to see the names associated with this monstrosity.If you have 94 minutes to spare, just go and stare at a wall, you may find it more entertaining.
