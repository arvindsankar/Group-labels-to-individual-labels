Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies i ever seen ! I think the effects was created at MS Paint and the light director was sick and do not attend any single scene shooting. The movie is dark, the colors are bad. The effects is horrible.Technique in general is very weak.Turkish soccer followers know what "Goal-Keeper Rüştü Make-Up". At the face of the baby is this make up applied. Brrr... It get cold.On the other side, the script is full of sexism. It seems like abortion is only the mothers problem, but it is not! A bit of mystery, a bit of sex, a bit of horror, religion and spice... I think, people should watch this film to understand what "bad" is.
