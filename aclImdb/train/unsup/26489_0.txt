There already is a TV series called "Buried Alive" directed by Patrick Cowap:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421302/Based on the DVD cover, my girlfriend bought the Lions Gate DVD thinking it was an interesting science fiction movie.This movie is really just about a man made "Landslide" hitting a condominium complex.There is no science fiction, terrible special effects and a predictable plot.Save your money and watch something else.
