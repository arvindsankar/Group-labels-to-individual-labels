Dazzle is an enchanting balance of light-heartedness and innocent humor.Surprisingly, the movie is cleverly woven. Nice touches include Tom as an author of children's books about faeries as well as Shakespeare's fairy play within the play, Midsummer Night's Dream.The gnomes Oddkin and Bodkin impart amusement, keep the comedy cheerful, and provide balance for the mildly menacing antagonist, the Collector. Melissa is disarmingly charming. Tom and Crystal share a believable chemistry. Ms. Martinet adds a touch of complication as both the skeptic science teacher, rival love interest, and, ironically, the school play director. Tom's publisher and son help with unobtrusive story exposition.The movie is warm without being maudlin.Highly recommended.
