With movies like this, I wonder how no one thought to stop thething long before shooting wraps. Movies like Yor force me toargue for a referee who can bring a halt to shooting a troubledmovie, much in the same way a referee saves a boxer in danger. When would the ref have brought an end to things? Reb Brown'sfirst appearance might have ended it, or maybe the first papier- mache dinosaur would have brought the ref's arms up. Eitherway, we would have been saved from 100 minutes or so of thisdrag.
