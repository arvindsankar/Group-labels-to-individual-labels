I watched this epic when it was first released on Aussie TV. I was 18. I watched it again this week and enjoyed it even more. THis drama is well written, the cinematography is simply stunning and the talent is fabulous.Hugo Weaving plays a magnificent portrayal of a man who's life long quest to build an empire in the Australia Outback.Living in the Central West and well not really that far from Nevertire where the story is based, I understand the trials and tribulations of life in the bush.Steve Jacobs by far is my favourite in this film.I could watch this over and over. There are no special features, no fan fare or special effects. The film relies sole on a wonderful story and fantastic actors.I highly recommend this to anyone!
