Hard to imagine that this film is rated under a 6.0 on imdb. I would place it easily among the top 50 comedies of all time.Michael J. Fox plays a hard charging Dr. Ben Stone, with David Ogden Stiers giving a world class performance as the small town mayor that needs a new doctor, and also knows a thing or two about happiness.And then there is Nurse Packer who believes in procedure and punchcards, Julie Warner providing a memorable 'swimming' performance, fishing without hooks, the squash festival, a great rendition of Patsy Cline's "Crazy", and of course, the Pakistani.Way underrated movie that stands up over time.9 out of 10
