The irony of this film the is that the reaction of the producer in the first few scene, should have been the same as the real producer.What a load of self-indulgent drivel this was.I'm not going to go in detail as there isn't really much to comment on, no real jokes, poor acting, no direction, no story.The scene with the salad summed the whole thing up. Lets throw in a pie-in-the-face scene that'll get a laugh.I saw this film on a flight from Salt Lake to Boston and I don't recall seeing anyone even smile let alone laugh. Rightly flopped at the box office. 0/10
