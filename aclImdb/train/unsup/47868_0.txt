Fair play to the guy who shot Beyond Vanilla, he took a risk.On the other hand the production is so bad, the film quality is very low, there is no script, no structure, no insight into the psyche of people interviewed and their movie for getting involved in kinky play. Some pictures are in for shock value but add nothing to the essay.Apart from the main man showing off in a leather cap, was there any reason to shoot - and show- this movie?
