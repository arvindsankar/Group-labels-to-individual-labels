When I got this game I thought, 'Wow this is fun!' ...but it gets very old very fast. For each 'Chapter' you play, you must obtain certain goals. Almost all of which are the same. There is always one unique goal for each chapter. Other than that, you go around stopping the same crimes over and over again. It gets ridiculous. Same goes for the dialog. The same BAD jokes over and over again, Sometimes twice is a row. Example - Woman: 'Spiderman, You da man!'Spiderman: 'Thanks ... you da woman?'(8 Seconds Later)Woman: 'Spiderman, You da man!'Spiderman: 'Thanks ... you da woman?'As for comparing it to GTA, I can see how people can think that. Yet something is off with the surroundings. You see, the GTA series has found a way to make their cities have a different look for different areas. In Spiderman 2, everything has the same 'blah' quality to it, throughout the city. It almost feels like you're web-slinging through a map of cubes rather than buildings. Also, the graphics look like they were made for the original Playstation as opposed to PS2.I wouldn't recommend this game, in my opinion, the original Spider-Man video game for the PS1 was much more fun than this one. At least it didn't get so old so quick. This game leaves you wanting more. But not in a good way.
