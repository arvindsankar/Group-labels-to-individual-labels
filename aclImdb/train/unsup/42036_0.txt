This was Akki's first film with DD who is known for his mad films, Akki had done a comic role before in SUHAAG(94) but here he plays a full comedianThe movie is a full crap and surprisingly DD released it with another film of his DEEWANA MASTANA which had better actors like Anil and Govinda(at least that time) and that film workedThis film is a complete crap film and makes no sense and it doesn't even keep you entertained, A must for comediesThe comedy scenes are trite while the main plot is itself senseless and the attempts to comedy are foolhardy though the message is a nice oneDirection by DD is bad Music is okayAkshay seems uncomfortable in the comedy set up as it was his first attempt and he was a bad actor those days He shouts too loud and comes across as a poor man's Govinda Juhi is amazing in her comic role and steals the show Kader repeats his act, Paresh is awful Satish Kaushik annoys Gulshan Grover has an indefinite role
