This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.The story is moronic, the actors are horrible, I don't see anything rewarding in it other than Erin Bartlett's casabas.The way the 2 leads throw around the LOVE word toward the end makes my stomach turn. Was this movie actually written by a 15 year old?Hopefully the 18 year old girls this movie is aimed at are too busy to watch it...its PATHETIC!I'm sorry I couldn't give it less than a 1, because that is overrating it considerably.
