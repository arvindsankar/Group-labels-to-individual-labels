Just like Asylum's version of War Of The Worlds, this film has the following characteristics:- Poor acting - Bad effects - Continuity errors all over the place - A few 'glowing reviews' that cannot possibly be real - Timed to coincide with the release of a similar big-budget movieAfter the first 20 minutes I had to stop watching it, else my foot would have gone through the screen.It's not the few dollars that I paid to rent this rubbish, but the fact that I feel cheated once again.Remember the name: 'Asylum' - the movie company to avoid.
