I do not want to give too much away about this film as it is worth watching not knowing the sequence of the events as the film unfolds.This black comedy is about a TV chef whose days are numbered and his show is axed by the producers.He is at the end of his tether about the loss of his show, his celebrity lifestyle and reputation as a chef. What is he to do?He throws a dinner party an a subsequent events are a combination of tense and tragi-comic action.The film is carried a long at a steady pace as the characters and plot evolve until the arrival of uninvited guests when the pace becomes frantic.The excellent work of the director Robert Heath is ably supported by a very strong cast. It was a pleasure to derive such entertainment from a British film
