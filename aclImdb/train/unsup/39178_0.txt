When I say 1/10 I really mean awful in a cringing but enjoyable sort of way.This movie was shown late at night because it is supposed to be scary but I found it hilarious! Any body who tries to analyse the characters or seeks hidden meanings needs to watch more movies like "Atomic train" and "Tales from the crypt." Christopher Lloyd must have had De ja vous of "Thing" from "The Adams family" when filming this little beauty.A fun movie to watch with your mates when your all broke and drunk on cider and cheap wine! I urge you to add this to your DVD collection or a very least borrow it from someone.
