To me this was a shameless display of female flesh. I know mostmen will say what's wrong with that! But when I watch a Movie Iwant to be entertained by the story and the plot as well as thescenery. To me this was a way for Demi Moore to show off hernew body. It was like Charlie's Angels meets the Matrix it wasoverdone and unbelievable. The story itself was flimsy at best. Ienjoy looking at beautiful women as much as the next guy but atleast let it be in an entertaining way. I mean it is as if the said let'ssee how many times can we use our new special effects technology and get away with it. Overall I would call it beautifulwomen in tight skimpy clothes with Charlie's Angels as a subplot.Icertainly hope this is the last of Charlie's Angels. I Also hope thatthe three ladies will take some much needed acting classes.
