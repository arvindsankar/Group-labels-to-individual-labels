This is was my first feature film where I portrayed Alex as Salma's husband.It was the greatest experience I ever had working on the set of "Bong Connection".It helped me a lot to understand the procedure of film-making and to gain more experience from other actors involved. I would like to thank Peeya and Samrat for giving me the chance to spend some time with them during their time in Houston.My special thanks to Anjan Dutt, the director and Joy, the producer for giving me the opportunity to be in their film. Thanks for casting me.
