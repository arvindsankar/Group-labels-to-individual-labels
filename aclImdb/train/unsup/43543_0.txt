I think that our subtitles weren't right, which is odd, since we rent it from a normal video shop. The conversations weren't going anywhere. Anyone knows what was wrong with the womens eye(?)I survived 102 minutes of film, glad to never see it again.What i really thought was annoying, was the lack of ending, it suddenly stops when the 2 girls are swimming...uh.Let this be a warning for you people. Don't go see this movie, when you don't speak Spanish.The movie has more than one story lines. None are worked out well as far as I'm concerned.
