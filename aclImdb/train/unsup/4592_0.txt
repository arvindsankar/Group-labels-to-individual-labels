This is an extraordinary fable about aging and about film-making.This old actor, unhappy with the route of his career is also the symbol of the great problem faced by the elder ones: looking back and not finding something to be proud about.However youth comes to rescue him, giving him a chance to always be remembered by spectators and to feel useful to a new generation.Especially well achieve by Cronenberg is the camera motion and positioning, which seems that of a child discovering all the potential of the found camera.Pure brilliance!
