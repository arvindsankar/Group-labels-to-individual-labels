An Oscar nominee for it's brilliant cinematography, and a Golden Globe nominee for Best Foreign Language Film (lost to Les mis√©rables), this film is directed by Zhang Yimou and stars Gong Li. They worked previously on five films: Red Sorghum, Ju Dou, Raise the Red Lantern, The Story of Qui Ju and To Live.14-year old Shuisheng (Wang Xiao Xiao) is brought in from the country to serve the Boss' mistress Bijou (Gong Li), who he can't control.Shuisheng soon finds that she is not a nice person, and he gets back at her when he can.I especially liked the bar scenes where Bijou performed. It had the right mix of beautiful costumes and smokiness.But, this was a gangster picture, so things end badly for some.
