In its genre: fantasy and sci-fi this is a guaranteed winner. Yes, it IS Alien vs. Highlander... and if you don't think that sounds awesome, well then you're missing out.What lifts this though is a great cast, tight filming, good production, and above all that some heart and soul that's been missing.Honestly this is straight-out entertainment - the Alien is seriously bad, and the Nordic stuff is just how you'd want it to be. Just violent enough, with some horror, but nothing OTT it is very, very good at achieving its objectives.All in all a great film and a definite Sci-Fi / Fantasy con favorite in the making...
