James Ellroy fans will probably want to check this out. They especially are the ones who should avoid it.Ellroy writes complex, psychologically damaged characters. James W. Harris's screenplay loses all that. It's watered-down and dumbed-down, making this just another average cop thriller.Stick with L.A. CONFIDENTIAL or BROWN'S REQUIEM instead.
