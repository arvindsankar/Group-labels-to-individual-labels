There is always money to be made and political power to be gained by sensationalistic fear-mongering - which is exactly what 11th Hour is all about.These fear-mongers claim that we're heading down the wrong path and that we're all going to die. Well then, if our path is so wrong...Why is it that people in industrialized nations are healthier and living longer than at any other time in history? Why is it that industrialized nations enjoy a higher standard of living than at any other time in history? Why is it that our biggest health problem in the USA is that we have too much food and life is too easy? How can our air and water be killing us when we are thriving on it and living longer and healthier than ever? And as if that's not good enough, why is it that, in industrialized nations, the air and water quality is always getting even better? Why is it that the air and water quality and the environment are cleaner and healthier in industrialized nations than in our third-world counterparts? How can ours be the path to over-population when the populations of industrialized nations are either steady or slightly decreasing? Why aren't the unindustrialized, third-world nations a threat when their populations are increasing exponentially? Why shouldn't we expect global temperatures to increase since we are still coming out of the last Ice Age? And has anybody noticed that the temperatures of Mars, Jupiter and Neptune have also been steadily increasing? Over 90 percent of Earth's history was warmer than now.The only threat our present path will bring is a threat to the power the elite try to wield over the "little people." Films like The Eleventh Hour try to keep us in fear and obedient to political authority. Don't be a useful idiot and don't buy into this crap.
