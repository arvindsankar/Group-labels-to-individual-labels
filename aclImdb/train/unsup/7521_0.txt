I had no idea what to expect from this film, and by the 10 minute mark it won me over.Tilda Swinton and Amber Tamblyn both gave stellar performances.The script was tight, and the back and forth between the Swinton and Tamblyn was spot-on perfect.Tamblyn's big bathroom scene was gripping and intense - a great use of the absence of sound to really hammer a point home.The cinematography left a little to be desired - the HD format still looks like video at times.I can see why Swinton Exec. Produced this: It was a great vehicle for her and I now have a new found respect for her as an artist.I am looking forward to Brougher's next film - hopefully she will get a wider release this time.The editing of the film was eerily effective - I was never once lost or confused, yet I was constantly being moved around time and space.The ending was very satisfying - I don't need to be spoon fed every little thing.Concise, daring script + great performances = "Stephanie Daley"
