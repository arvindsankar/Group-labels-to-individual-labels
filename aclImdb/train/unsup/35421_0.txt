How could Willem Defoe and Samuel L. Jackson associate themselves with this piece of crap? I have seen better comic books.The only thing worse than the acting was the clearly improbable plot.The special effects were laughable.The acting was stiff and not credible.The storyline must have been written by a five year old.It takes far less than ten lines to describe this movie.Too bad the lowest rating I could assign was a one.Oh all right, the blonde was kind of hot.Nonetheless, it took less time to write this screenplay than it did to watch it, even on fast forward.
