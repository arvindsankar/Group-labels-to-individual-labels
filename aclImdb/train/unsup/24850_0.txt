The title says it all.The story was great....a plot, a love story, a struggle, etc....The acting wasn't great, but it was good. I think all the actors did a fair job.The only real problem with the movie was its dialogue. It was so verbose that it was unrealistic that, even in the 50s they would speak that way. It's like every sentence had to be stated in absolute verbose perfection as if it was being read from a book. Real dialogue needs to sound like people would actually talk.An exceptional performance by Robbie Benson, btw.
