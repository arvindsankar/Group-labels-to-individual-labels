Anybody else think this is a total rip off!? Gus Van Sant did it way better! Daft Punk did almost exact shots! Who does that? Desert scenes. Slowly walking in the desert. Fatigued. Giving up. Death. The only different was that in Gerry, they were humans. I love Daft Punk, and I really liked the last burning scene, however, it was totally a rip off. Great songs too, but too similar to call an original movie. At least cite Gus Van Sant's work.Human After All.-Raymond
