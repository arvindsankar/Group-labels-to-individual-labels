Royal Rumble 2006 was a horrible show. 2 good matches, 1 decent and the rest were horrible which I believe was 3.Cruiserweight Open: This was a great way to open the show, a lot of high flying spots made it better. **1/4 Boogeyman vs JBL: Why is this on the card again. Just horrible. Luckily, kept short. DUD Mickie James vs Ashley with Trish Stratus as Referee: Another horrible match. I wasn't in to it at all and the crowd wasn't either. Not hard to tell why though. DUD Royal Rumble Match: Why is this in the middle again? Please explain. This was a decent match, nothing spectacular. This may have been the worst Royal Rumble Match ever though. **1/4 John Cena vs Edge: This was another decent match. This was the best match on the card though, but not too impressive. 10 minutes long wasn't so long though. Decent like I said. **1/4 Mark Henry vs Kurt Angle: Why is this the main event. This must have been the worse Main Event ever. * Royal Rumble 2006 is a D.
