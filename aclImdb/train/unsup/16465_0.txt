I ordered the movie and thought I'd ordered a DVD but received a VHS tape. I now see that it is not available on DVD, so a tape is OK.This is one cool movie that I can watch over and over and see new stuff.Great family movie too.We really lost a great new movie star when we lost River Phoenix.WHEN IS THIS MOVIE GOING TO BE ON DVD???
