Action?? Where...? Comedy?? Well, they make a very very bad movie, worst then D movie, and too late, they saw what a mistake it was. What do they do then? Call it a Comedy!! Hahaha.. loooosers.Horror?? Come on.. 2 drops of blood on a neck!! F/x is totally worst then zero.Thriller?? lol!!!C. Thomas Howell and Tony Todd!! For example.. In this movie!! Don't ask me why or how, it's over my head. I'm tired of all this low budget, low serious 'horror' movies. Why not try to make a good movie for a change...? I recommend Hatchet and Feast instead...!! // Cheers
