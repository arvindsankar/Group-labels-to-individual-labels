The scene where his mum and dad went to bail Blue?? from jail.She was sprinkling Holy water!!!.She was cursing all the demons (in the form of prisoners)to disappear.That scene almost killed me.I actually laughed and ended up weeping.When some of the prisoners heckled her, she shouted at them, "Your Mama, All your mamas".That's one of my fave jail scenes of all time.Get Back Satan.Disappear Demons!!!!!!!!
