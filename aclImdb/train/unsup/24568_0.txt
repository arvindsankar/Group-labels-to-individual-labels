This is a really cool movie! I enjoyed it immensely, and watch it every time it is on TV.This movie, "Ghost Cat", deserves to be on DVD!It's the ultimate Halloween movie for the whole family.If you are an animal lover, "Ghost Cat" will be one of your favorite movies.Maybe if we all contact Animal Planet, or the Studio that made the movie, and ask them to put this movie on DVD, they will.Ghost Cat has a special charm to it, that is sorely lacking in many movies.It is a very special movie.Let's put it on DVD!
