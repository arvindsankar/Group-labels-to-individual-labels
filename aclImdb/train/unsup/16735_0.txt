"Futurama" is truly one of the best television shows ever.The witty lines and many many pop culture, science, and sci-fi references are just as good as those used in the more widely known "The Simpsons", also created by Matt Groening.The show at various times has mocked all of the great Sci-Fi shows as well as the typical historic sources "The Simpsons" more often references.They pick apart practically any stereotype they see, and give us a good time in the process.For anybody that enjoys good humor who isn't very familiar with the show, check out "Futurama".
