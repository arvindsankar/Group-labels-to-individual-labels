Well, by camera work I really mean all visual effects as well as the cinematography, set design... it's a visual treat. The effects used to dramatize Bob McConnell's sense of isolation and loneliness were intriguing.Also great acting by Mr. Slater, as usual. I like this guy's work.It's nice to see William Macy in a different type of role than I usually see him in, but anyone could have done that turn -- not much there for him to do, but he ably supports, which is a fine thing, since that's what his role here should be...In some ways, it reminded me of Fight Club.Saw this on an airplane today, and now I'm kicking back and looking it up. I quite enjoyed it.
