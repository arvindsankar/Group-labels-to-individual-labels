If I could rate this movie as a zero I would - but the lowest rating is a 1. This movie looks as if some high school kids broke into their AV department, stole some equipment and decided to make a movie. The DVD boxes these movies are getting displayed with are so much better. I used to look at DVD cases to see if it looked like a cheesy B-movie flick -this one didn't look like a bad one - I was wrong- it was pretty bad.If you are willing to waste an hour and a half of your life, do it watching paint dry instead of this.I just love the name of the production company though - Aeriola productions!
