wow, was this film awful....$1 rental at redbox wasted.the only reason i watched the whole thing is because i'm paralyzed and when in bed i couldn't shut it off myself, lol.every scene was long and drawn out with boring camera scenes.the flashbacks were long and boring and very predictable.nothing was interesting or scary.you could cut out 45 minutes of this film and not lose anything to the story.the cast was awful, and i wanted the spirit to kill everyone just so movie would end.i'd watch my mother the car reruns before this film, hehe.the only thing the writer should feel proud of is she found a sucker to finance it.Stink-A-Roo don't waste your time.
