Ha! Ha! What a joke. A killer guy in a raincoat goes on a killing rampage is the stupidest idea in the first place. This is the worst movie idea since Uncle Sam.This film is only scary for little babies. If this movie scares you, you probably get scare so easily.Come on! This guy kills people with an hook. Thats a big rip-off of the great horror hit, Candyman.No-- I didn't liked the first movie, I'd think the entire thing about the man in a raincoat with a hook is so stupid in the first place. I've seen horror movies that went only to video is better than this movie.So, I gave this movie 1/2*
