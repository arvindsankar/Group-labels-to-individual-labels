This film which I just saw is extremely powerful. I, myself am aCatholic so I found this film of special interest since it is about aJesuit Priest. The priest is a brave but flawed man. The theologyof the time was also extremely flawed. Especially the reasons forconverting people. But the film is all about the ending. SPOILERALERT: When the Native Americans tell the priest baptize thembecause he loves them and not because baptizes them for theirconversion or because they believe it is a magical ritual that wouldcure them. This almost moved me to tears. This is whatconversion and baptism should be about.
