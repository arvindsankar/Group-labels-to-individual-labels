if i went into this expecting a serious film, i would be disappointed but... the film begins with a request to suspend disbeliefif you have been to and enjoyed renaissance faires - this is a good film for you, especially if you've enjoyed the work of don juan and miguel in personif you're looking for fast paced humor - the weam dreaver is hysterically funnypersonally, i enjoy films where it's clear the cast and crew enjoyed making the film - this is clearly the case hereif you're looking for a film to have fun with, not take seriously, and play along with being silly - you will LOVE this (we did)
