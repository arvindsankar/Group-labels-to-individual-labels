I hadn't realized how truly warped and twisted the mind of Andy Dick was until he had his own series (for at least a while).His skits along with his support team actors would have me actually snickering out loud as they went wa-a-ay over the edge in doing something completely ridiculous.I was genuinely impressed by the absurdism displayed. Some of the stuff fell a little flat. But mostly the skits spoofed this and that in grand, no-holds-barred style. Andy Dick could skewer some social cutesyness or some aspect of the current pop culture with devastating results. He certainly could expose some social stupidness for the true stupidness it really was.The Andy Dick show was definitely NOT dripping and oozing with Care Bears sweetiness.Yep. I was left quite impressed with much of his series.Silliness with a message.
