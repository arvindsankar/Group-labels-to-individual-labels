Hi I too have seen the movie Buddies, I am looking for a copy of the movie for my mum and dad.They had a copy but is got misplaced in travel years ago.My parents went to the World Premiere on Wednesday, July 20th 1983, for Buddies.This was a great day for them as they loved it very much.In 1982 they also had an investment in the movie Buddies.My parents also have paper write ups about the movie.I wish that it could be played on TV again because it was such a great film. So if any one out there could help me get a copy of it again i would be very grateful please contact me please Janelle
