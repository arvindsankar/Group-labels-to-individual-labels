Just to clarify the above statement quote"Michael Knight's evil twin brother Garth" Michael Knight is in no way related to Garth because Michael Knight is an alias created by Garths father(cant remember full name) for Michael Long. A cop who is nearly killed by a scandal that is outlined in the pilot and as well in later episodes. I saw the movie as well and i thought it was mildly entertaining although i have to agree that it was overall a bad attempt to milk the TV series.
