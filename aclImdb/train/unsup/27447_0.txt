I had completely forgotten this film existed until the notice about Jack Black playing (im assuming) a live version of the title character. I used to watch this all the time when I was little, I absolutely loved it! The animation was brilliant for the time, the story was wonderful, full of hope and romance and everything I had wanted as a little girl.I have never read the book so I am not sure of how close it follows the story, but even as a stand alone film you could not deny the magic behind it! I'm away to find it on DVD so I can watch it again and bring back all the happy memories! :D
