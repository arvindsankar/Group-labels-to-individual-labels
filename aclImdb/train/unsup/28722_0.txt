I seem to remember an OLD cartoon that did the story more justice than this film. In fact--and I'm not usually one to say this--the book is way better than the film. But for those without a vivid imagination, the CG is (or was at the time) the best. In any case, it's worth watching if you like the book. It's worth watching if you didn't like the book. It's worth watching if you've never heard of any of the books. And it's worth watching again because it's so beautiful. I give it only 7 out of 10 because I was disappointed that the story that I loved wasn't fully realized (IMO).
