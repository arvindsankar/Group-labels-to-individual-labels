A Winter Tale is a beautifully shot feature that highlights men's communication skills regarding gun violence.Shot on location in Toronto's inner city neighbourhood of Parkdale, this crucially relevant film is all too timely.We feel the characters viscerally, as if the film were a documentary, but its narrative flow and close camera work draws the audience in to experience the action as if we were part of the circle, face to face with real people with whom we can identify.Scene by scene, Parkdale comes to life in full spectrum; character is revealed through a grim, suspenseful inevitability.A Winter Tale does not provide answers to Toronto's gun violence per se, but it does expose the difficulties­ and the necessity­ in ensuring that a dialogue about these issues gets started.
