The promise of the series has been better than the fulfillment.Some of the programs, particularly those hour-long ones, havebeen ludicrous (A Neronian word?) and chaotic because of thecondensation required to fit the time limits. This particular onebelongs to the better installments.As has been mentioned before, Maury Chaykin fits the descriptionof the part but is less than commanding even as Timothy Hutton isfine. Perhaps Thayer David was the best Nero but he did only oneinstallment before his untimely death (Perhaps a result of thepreviously mentioned physical requirements for the part.). WilliamConrad, I thought, was twinkly and simply awful.The others are fine in their recurring smaller parts and the serieshas the proper period feel of the novels.
