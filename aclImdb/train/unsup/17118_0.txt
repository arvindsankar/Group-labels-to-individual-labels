For the third Crow outing, I was left feeling rather skeptical of watching this considering the disaster with City of Angels? I actually purchased this film on DVD in May last year and regrettably passed on to a friend considering I wasn't going to watch this too often as much as the original. This time around it seems to have learnt from the mistakes from the 2nd part by sticking very closely with the themes of the original.Eric Mabius was a surprise indeed for the lead with Kirstin Dunst on hand in a supporting role. Parts of the film did lack in places but was still exceptional viewing nevertheless. I wasn't too sure about the villainy, as I thought the police being behind the murderous cover-up of Alex Corvis's (Eric Mabius) girlfriend (played by Jodie-Lynn O'Keefe) was little cheesy not mention repetitive with the idea of the police being the bad guys.Visually it does resemble the original a lot and thumbs up Eric Mabius as well as he does pay homage to Brandon Lee very well.I thought Fed Ward wasn't as menacing as he appeared to be, but was decent attempt.Not bad, but please tell Miramax/Dimension to stop panning out any further Crow sequels as they really should have learnt their lesson with the last outing.
