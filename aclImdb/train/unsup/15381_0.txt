It's been a long time since I've seen such a well enacted and so realistic TV Series.It seems that the "narcotraficantes", some of whom I would call "NACOtraficantes" are just as real as the ones who vandalize and terrify Mexican life in the border as of today.It is somehow awkward the mix of English and Spanish and I just wonder if this is the kind of language spoken in the US-Mexican border. I've been to Laredo/Nuevo Laredo once and indeed it seems to be like this.It is also true that today the blood bath seems to be many times worse than when the movie was filmed.It's a shame that the series has been shut down.A friend of mine lent me the three DVDs and I couldn't stop until I saw all the episodes.
