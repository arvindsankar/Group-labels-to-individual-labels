This is a film meant ONLY for the theaters, and should be restricted to IMAX to boot.I just watched this on a regular TV/DVD player. Okay, although it may have been a viewing experience in the theater it was boring at home.I was bored, granted I didn't experience the film the way it was meant to be.That being said, this was another film that banked mostly on the effects (computer 3d animation) and little on the story. Yes, it was a cartoon, basically, so what kind of acting can you get out of a cartoon.All I can say is that the film ended with me feeling cheated.
