Dead Life is without a doubt the saddest attempt at film-making I have ever witnessed.From a technical viewpoint, this film is a mess. The image quality varies greatly throughout the entire movie, sometimes switching to black and white for no apparent reason. The computer graphic scene is reminiscent of an early Atari game.The soundtrack is out of sync during much of the film, and it's quality fluctuates.The plot is thin and hard to follow. It is often impossible to understand the motivation for the actors actions.The skill of the actors makes it painfully clear that they were chosen for their ability to arrive on the set, rather than talent.This film is full of inconsistencies, hair length and clothing change inexplicably, the same extras appear in two consecutive scenes, supposedly miles away... The list could go on, but I'm getting bored with this review, just as I was when watching this poor excuse for entertainment.After watching Dead Life, I was surprised to find that it wasn't made as a middle school drama class project.I'm a big fan of B movies, but Dead Life is an F at best.
