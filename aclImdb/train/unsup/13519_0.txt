I still don't now if these twins are conjoined or not. Most say they are not. There performances were superb. No matter what, they are not freaks.They are two sensitive people trapped in the same body. I only wanted the very best for them. An empathy developed. It is sad that nature plays such downright dirty tricks. They were the nicest people around. It makes you want to help the less fortunate.I give this film 10 stars. I will see it again.
