I cried when I thought about all the money that the filmmakers wasted on making this garbage movie.I cried when I thought about all the money I've wasted watching utterly predictable formulaic movies as this.I cried when I realized that I live in the greatest country in the world and some foreigner may see this film and think it's representative of American filmmakers' capacity.I cried when I realized the stars of this movie are still employed.If this is what Hollywood is producing these days, I'll be crying for a real long time.Stay away; this movie was horrible.
