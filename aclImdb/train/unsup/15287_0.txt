Well that about says it all. I couldn't agree more with the other commentators on this movie. After watching it for 10 minutes the first thought of pressing the "STOP" button on the remote was triggered.But being a big SCI-FI buff and not wanting to jump to conclusions after the first minutes of viewing I decided to show mercy and watched it to the end, thinking it might become better as it went along.Big mistake..It didn't got better. After the ending I had absolutely no idea what this "movie" was about. The characters are as thin as cardboard and the storyline.. Well, if any of you figure it out feel free to drop me a line.On second thought let's forget about this movie and speak of it no more.Don't:A) waste your money buying it.B) waste your time watching it, andC) don't say I didn't warn you...I thought I could digest just about any SF movie, until Ice Planet came along.
