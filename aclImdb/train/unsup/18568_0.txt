This film is unfathomably bad. The script sounds like it was doctored purposefully to be the worse script ever. The 'story' jumped around and the pacing was awful. The film in general made no sense. In some scenes you could see the auto exposure kick in, and some shots had a rounded border. Everything seemed carefully made to be amazingly rubbish. The special features include a 'Main Menu', 'Chapter Selection' and 'Original Soundtrack'.I laughed so hard at everything after watching this my face hurt.
