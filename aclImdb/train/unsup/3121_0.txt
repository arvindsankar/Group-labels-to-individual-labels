Seinfeld is perhaps the best comedian alive today. Here is why, his jokes are funny, he works the audience, uses body motion and lastly, his jokes are CLEAN. Too many comedians think that they are funny because they curse every other word and repeat the same joke 10 different ways.Seinfeld tells his joke, it is funny, clean and he gets the punch out the first time around.All comedians need to watch this DVD and learn from him.I recommend this to everyone. You will start laughing from the very beginning and you will not stop until the end! Enjoy
