Hmmm ... just saw this piece at the Horrorfest and I wish I had used these 90 minutes for more useful activities, like shooting myself in the head or something ...... but seriously, this is the dumbest plot since 'Slumber Party Massacre 17'. It shamelessly rips of 'Wrong Turn', and in a totally uninspired and lame way.My rating in detail:1 star for cinematography (ok, but barely) 1 star for the music (it didn't hurt) 2 stars for acting (sticks out because the rest of this film is so bad) -2 stars for the scriptThe only positive: James Burns obviously has tremendous fun playing the sadistic Sheriff - it's a pleasure to watch himMakes for 2 stars overall - and that's generous. Save time and money and avoid this one.
