Evil Dead II (1987) After the huge success of the first film, Sam Raimi andBruce Campbell reunite for this Quasi-Remake/Sequel. Ash and his ladyare off on a nice trip through the woods. They stop off and rest inside anold cabin. Does Ash realize that he's been here before, or hasn't he? Raimi and company (armed with a bigger budget and over the top special effects) bring us the second installment of the Evil Dead series. This film focusesmore on black humor and camp instead of shock and horror. Technicallythis film is far superior to the one that was release a few years back and in many ways it's a better film.What a better way to spend the night? Watch Evil Dead II with some ofyour friends and let the party begin! Leave all logic at the door. Remember, this is a movie, and a fun one at that.Highly recommended!A++
