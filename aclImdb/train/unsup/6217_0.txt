Yet again the Brits show that you don't need a big budget in order to make a good movie.The movie has an high fun level supported by the great middle aged female cast. It's a shame that later on in the movie the movie falls into some obvious and dramatic cliche's. The true power of the movie is all in the acting by the ladies who are all very real and warm in their performances. They are very British and yes that is a compliment. Also the rest of the movie is typically British including the wonderful humor.I also quite enjoyed Ciar√°n Hinds in a role you won't often see him in, that of a perfectly normal sweet guy. It was great to see a good male performance by an actor in a movie in which the majority is female.A nice little warm and fun movie.7/10
