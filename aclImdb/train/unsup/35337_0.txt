awesome backgrounds, horrible popeye style characters, horrible use of american music.lame plot: just like A.I. it starts good then degenerates into Pinochio (sp)? i don't CARE about robots.and tell me i didn't hear freddie prinz jr doing a voice. - that's the kind of crap that ruined Princess Mononoke.i'm gonna watch it again in japanese w/ subtitles.
