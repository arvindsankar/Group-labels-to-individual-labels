Whilst far from perfect, this is a very good anthology of horror stories.There is very little gore, but the stories build up a good atmosphere, and the acting is always of at least an acceptable level, and in the cases of Robin Bailey,Jean Anderson and Dora Bryan, it is actually quite excellent.In the middle story involving people moving into a house, I actually felt quite creeped out, something that hasn't happened for years to me.I would love to know the story as to how three short English tales ended up juxtaposed with the wrap around story of thieves stealing the tapes from a store, but whatever, it doesn't detract from the stories themselves.The copy I have seen has washed out colours which somehow added to the bleakness, and this is shot on film it would appear, doesn't look cheap and nasty at all.If you are a fan of brit horror, you must see this it's definitely a bit of a lost gem as far as I'm concerned.
