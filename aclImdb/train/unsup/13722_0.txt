I first saw this film a few years ago. I was so utterly disgusted and horrified (mostly because it was billed as a "comedy"), I never wanted to see it again. Ever.Then, recently, I saw it again. I was still disgusted and horrified, but (since I learned a lot about abnormal psychology during the intervening years), I saw how brilliant "In the Company of Men" truly is...I've watched it many times since.This is not a film for just anyone to see. This is almost a film I wish no one would ever have to see. I think there maybe ought to be a warning label attached to it. BEWARE: EXTREME CRUELTY WITHIN!But for those who have the stomach for it, "In the Company of Men" is a fascinating excursion into the dark world of Sadistic Personality Disorder. The "protagonist" (Aaron Eckhart), is a perfect example of this psychological malady. His little buddy (Matt Maloy) is a study in Dependent Personality Disorder. The girl "they" decide to torment (Stacy Edwards) is nothing but a sweet, innocent bystander.It's a whole lot of tough going, emotionally...and I think that's the whole point.The way author/director Neil LaBute has crafted this disturbing, compelling work is how I wish creators of positive, heartwarming works would go about their business. I love a good, happiness-affirming movie. I'm a dork, I know. But I'd love to see a "happy-inducing" film grab onto my psyche the way "In the Company of Men" did. It's something.It's really something.
