I learned about this series of Vitaphone shorts while channel surfing... I tuned into the Golf channel and was wondering why they were showing an old B&W film. I continued watching until I slowly came to realize who I was watching... the great Bobby Jones.I had seen the film biography of Jones... and have visited a lot of the Jones memorials in Augusta GA. But this was the first time I saw and heard the great man.Cool!I plan on getting the DVD version of this series, given the practical instruction (despite the use of archaic terms like "Mashie Niblick" and "Spoon." This film... and the others in the series, are very highly recommended for all golfers!
