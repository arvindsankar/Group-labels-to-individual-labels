It says it is a thriller. I'm not sure I agree with it.It's like Big brother but every day the contestants are psychoanalyzed.It's insane. It has a lot of nudity but it's all in a good taste.The whole film has been shot with infra-red cameras except the game show host.The film was originally conceived in 1992. There was a book before that. I saw an interview with the director Nick Peterson/Virtual Alien where he said that the only reason he didn't sue the makers of Big Brother was that George Orwell should first have the copyright on the TV show.Full mark for the music score!
