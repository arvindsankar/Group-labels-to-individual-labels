(spoilers..within)My first of kukunoor and a great experience. The starting scenes are great..the dripping blood scene..and "Naseer in bank " scene....cinematography is great.The storyline is good ..though a few things are adopted from "shawshank redemption"..movie has it's own identity.A few scenes will leave u thrilled ...like the flashback scene in which Naseer noticed that Juhi was also in the court room....and the starting scenes b4 casting.jackie, juhi are good...and Naseer, wat can i say??..Nagesh is ok types,,but a good director.Nice work...a must see.........Bollywood is learning junta..cheer up!!!
