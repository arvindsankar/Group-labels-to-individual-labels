Like the only other person to comment this, I spotted it late one night on SBS (Australia's international channel).I wasn't really expecting anything at all - but this film was great! It's your classic cop buddy movie, your experience cop (ghostbuster) gets a new partner to break in - and as always there's a new bad guy (ghost) on the block.Action, comedy, romance, a couple of nice twists here and there to keep the whole thing entertaining.If you're a fan of Asian cinema, this is a great film. It's a little hard to get your hands on, try ebay.
