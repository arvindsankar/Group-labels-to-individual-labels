Tried to talk the kids out of this one but got stuck seeing it anyway. This is another in a trend of kids movies where morals go right out the window. Now, I like cute dog tricks as much as the next person, but this movie takes the cake. A building is broken into, stuff is stolen, numerous laws are broken, a work truck is repeatedly used without permission, adults are physically assaulted...but hey, they saved some dogs so all that stuff is cool and the kids "did the right thing" in the end.The acting is cardboard grade. And how on earth could a movie mess up pee pee and poop jokes in a movie aimed at children? I don't know, but this one sure did. In a crowded theater full of children, only a couple of them actually laughed at the toilet humor. That's a sad commentary on the movie itself...when even the poop jokes aren't funny to little kids.As numerous comments have already pointed out, the only thing this movie had going for it was the dogs. I will give it three out of ten stars out of respect for the dogs. If the dogs were gone, the only thing stopping this movie from getting negative ratings would be the fact that you can't do that on IMDb.Parents, if your kids love dogs, I'm sure there are better ways to let them see a movie about them than this movie.
