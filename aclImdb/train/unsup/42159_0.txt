I actually suffered through 10 minutes of this thinking that it might get better.... Please do yourself a favor, and don't bother watching this.Unless you enjoy intolerably bad movies, your time is better spent anywhere else. And I do mean ANYWHERE.It is hard to believe that any of these actors who participated in this movie did not get banned from the business permanently. It certainly is a black mark on their careers in my opinion.So, what was wrong with this movie? Poor Acting. Bad Jokes. Bad Plot.What is good about this movie? You don't have to watch it.
