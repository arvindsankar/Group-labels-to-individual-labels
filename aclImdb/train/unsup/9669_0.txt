Despite the best intentions and effort of all involved this just doesn't work.It has energy and tries hard but farce is a difficult trick to pull off - it requires real comic timing and really good situations.Unlike French farce this Hispanic farce relies on a single device: man dates three women all discover this then fall over each other to first get him for themselves, then a subplot involving criminals, then strong women emerge.My problems is this: a group of women watching this with pizza on a Friday night will enjoy the first 30 minutes and the last 15 but the bit in between just ain't entertainment. It's not the fault of script / director / actors: it just hasn't got enough steam to shine in any way.Love to see more films aimed at the Hispanic community: but comedy needs working on to make a great cross-over movie. Something dumb like LA rich kid goes to Puerto Rico might work, but sophisticated romantic comedy would be better.... best of all, why not try watching Almavador and see what happens? Please!
