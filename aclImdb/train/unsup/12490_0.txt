Young Brandon Marcel, (not listed anywhere in the credits) steals the show and "dies" well in this wonderful, uh yes, wonderful action thriller. (put down the knife, ill type) yes wonderful. I give it two dumbs up. While this Genre is alluring and enticing, this film really takes the cats pajamas and rams them head first into a brick wall (along with anyone who actually has the nerve or Sherlock Homes ability to find it!) Action packed and a thrill ride all the way. Grieco is at his New York Finest!A classic for the ages-----THE DARK AGES that is.Run out and buy while it lasts.GRIECOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
