I used to watch the 80s series remake of "Mission Impossible" and feel this movie is largely "Mission Impossible" in title only. It's really just a big star vehicle and money-making enterprise for Tom Cruise.Sure, it's an entertaining mindless romp that will keep your brain happily in neutral for a few hours and that may be all you're after.The revelation of who is the true villain will anger some fans such as myself. It really wasn't anything like the 80s "Mission Impossible" I remember. What about the comraderie between characters? What about the team effort thing? These things are missing because it's Tom Cruise Vs the rest of the world.The best thing about the film is Larry Mullen Jnr and Adam Clayton from U2 being on the soundtrack.
