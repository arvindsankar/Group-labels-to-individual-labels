It looked good on the trailer, I keyed in a reminder on my Digi Box, it came on, It was rubbish.Patrick Stewart an actor I admire- is he short of work?Also was this in 1863?Nemo said he had been on the island for 10 years, lost his family in the 'Indian Revolution' so that would have been 1853..Only I think he was vaguely referring to the Indian Mutiny, which happened in 1857..Confused, I was.also why were the pirates right off the set of 'Prates of the Caribbean??Who wrote this, a bunch of 9 year olds?
