That includes the worst movies ever made by a five year old kid with his parent's video camera. Trying to follow the plot was like looking at a Escher painting, but without anything interesting to see along the way. The acting was terrible, and the directing was worse. The best thing about the movie was making fun of it with my friends.I highly suggest that you don't see this movie unless you are: A) brain deadB) deaf AND blindC) punishing yourselfD) a cinematic masochistE) all of the abovePreferable E.
