Feroz Khan made several great entertainers like QURBANI, JAANBAAZ but this is his poorest work and his last try too at directionHe seems to want to glorify himself and his son and hence made this excuse of a filmThe film goes around with sub plots, sudden songs, long bike chases and then a melodrama about Feroz-FardeenThe film has a weak screenplay and seems all choppyTHe romance angle is puerileThe film actually is laughable The film shifts from 1 plot to another suddenly All doesn't make sense and plus the scenes are so badly handled The last scene is a perfect e.g. of a bad scene plus Fardeen's bad actFeroz Khan makes an embarrassment of a film Music is okayFeroz Khan is repetitive, Fardeen Khan is bad Celina is awful
