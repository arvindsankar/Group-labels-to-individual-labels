John Payne is driving his nice Chevy van filled with flowers and minding his own business when some peeping Tom decides to use him for less than legal purposes. That rascally Preston Foster is a smart bad guy with a plan to rob the bank.This movie should have been called "Four Kings." You will see why when you watch it. "Four Kings and a Queen" would be even better. "Kansas City Confidential" is OK, but it would not become a magnet that attracted people into the theater.Excellent performances by John Payne, Preston Foster, Jack Elam, Neville Brand and Lee Van Cleef. Coleen Gray does her part very well, also. She reminds me somewhat of a Gale Storm with the perky, happy quality usually not found in a gangster flick.This one could definitely be remade with a great cast today and it should do well. The story is solid. The few plot holes are minor and do not make us wonder.The musical score is also excellent. I was impressed with the camera work throughout. One scene in particular lets us see some guys getting onto a boat while we could still watch a nice old Mercury woody wagon and its occupant in the background. Many great 40s and early 50s vehicles here.A really good 50s B&W film.Tom Willett
