This has to easily be the worst movie I've ever seen. Admittadly, I saw this movie AFTER I saw Heavy Metal 2000, so I might be biased in my thoughts/opinions. While there are some O.K. Parts to this movie, 95% of it is worthless drible. The Animation is AWFUL by today's standards. Even in 1980 (4 years before I was born) it probably looked like garbage. It looks like a bad Sci Fi Beavis and Butthead. The story makes little sense. Of course, you don't watch these types of movies for plot, but they could have at least tried (like HVM 2000 -the plot wasn't much but at least it was there). The music is a bunch of 80's style Hard Rock. While middle-aged viewers might enjoy this 'music', I cant see anyone else enjoying it.The violence and nudity are all that anyone could possibly like about this movie. And if you really want that, then you could watch HVM 2000.Overall, 1/10. Only older people and geeks should watch this movie.James "Black Wolf" Johnston blackwolf14016@hotmail.com
