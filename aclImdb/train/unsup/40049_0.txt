This movie is so cheaply and badly made that "Plan 9 from outer space" looks like a big budget production in comparison. This, however, would still be excusable.The worst thing about the movie is that it features the on stage slaughtering of a real chicken.What a waste of live for such a crap!Has to be avoided at all cost!
