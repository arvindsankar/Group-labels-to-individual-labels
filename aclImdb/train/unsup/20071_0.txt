It's actually more than like Big Brother. It was like in a sect. The difference is that cameras are everywhere.All the contestants have to live in the dark for a period of one month. They are virtually prisoners.In fact, to add to the reality of it the director never informed the actors that the actual filming would be done in the dark.This caused a lot of problem. After a day of filming in the dark, one of the actors went completely mad and smashed a camera.He refused to go on and left the set. Soon after his lawyers threatened to sue if they didn't remove him.I wonder who it was. Anyone knows?They had to remove another actress who was shot in the nude, in the toilets and in the bathroom having a shower.She had second thoughts about the whole project.
