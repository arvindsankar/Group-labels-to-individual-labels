What a fabulous movie! I just saw a screening of it (with a bunch of other actors and writers) and the whole place burst into applause at the end.Tilda Swinton is amazing as the White Witch. Her cold, evil gaze could freeze anyone.I loved the kids - especially the little Georgie Henley, who played Lucy. Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan was suitably majestic and comforting and grand.It was beautifully filmed, and I felt Narnia was perfectly realized.Looking forward to the movies that will follow.
