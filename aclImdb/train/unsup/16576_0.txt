Pretentious and a huge waste of talent.Julia Roberts is a great actress and has a fantastic smile – a smile so un-really radiant that it becomes unreal pretty soon. That’s the risk she runs. And so does the movie.Dialogues for the single sister are good while the movie is quite pretentious and a drag at times.Dennis Quaid is fantastic. The story borders on the most idiotic generalization – southern men think with their southern asset and the women don’t have brains at all. Pretty idiotic fare.Gene Rowlands mom lacks depth and looks like she is on prescriptive medication - she takes a 180 degree turn in the middle of the movie. And Duvall's character is so foolish it hurts. The only saving grace is the dance sequence - but then I can bet there have been infinitely better results than this.
