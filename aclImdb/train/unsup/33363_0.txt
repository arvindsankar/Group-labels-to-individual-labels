I hadn't heard very good things, so I didn't go into it with high expectations, and still it managed to disappoint, big time.Where was the over-dramatic "after-school special" music? Where were Jerri's funky pets? Why did they change Derrick, using an actor that isn't butt-ugly? And why, for the love of God, wasn't it funny? Almost every joke felt forced, and half of them were simply recycled from the show.God...DAMN IT!I would much rather they just bring the show back. Probably not gonna happen, now that Colbert is such a big star that he's coining words that dictionaries take seriously. Come to think of it, whoever first said that "Strangers" would make a good movie was speaking nothing but truthiness.
