Is it just me, or the last few seasons of E.R. haven't even been worth watching. Tragedy after tragedy, plot twist after plot twist. These are the most ill-lucked people in society. OK, so...Dr. Green has cancer, dies. O.K., I can run with that. Perfectly logical. Dr. Romano has his arm cut off at the elbow by a tail rotor. O.K., not likely, but if he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time...then maybe. But come on, then to get killed by the same chopped falling in a bloody fire on top of his head? Get real. Carter loses his baby, and his woman. Yawn. Hasn't the Carter family seen enough in the way of loss and rich people dilemmas? I am so sick of the "strong females" Abby doesn't want to marry Luka. Sam didn't want to marry Luka. Sam and her son. Again, and again, and again. Now for the love of god her crazy ex-husband kidnapped him and her both at gunpoint and they are driving somewhere along the Chicago interstate. Abby might lose her baby. Dr. Corday almost lost her baby. Dr. Weaver was in limbo with her son, after miscarrying. Dr. Benton had custody trouble. Dr. Lewis lost her niece. Can't these people hold on to their children?At least they did away with Dr. Lewis' sister. Man that chick fell off Ugly Mountian and hit every damn boulder on the way down. If anyone agrees...write to me to tell me so, then write to NBC to take this long-dead show off the air.
