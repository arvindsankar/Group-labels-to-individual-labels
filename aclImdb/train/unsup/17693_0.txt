This film was just about perfect. My main complaint would be that it was not long enough.It is right up there with The Decline of Western Cilvilization: The Metal years and VH1's 4 part series on Metal. If you like punk, then you would enjoy American HardCore as well.The cool thing about these documentaries is that having grown up when most of these sounds were just kicking in, you get to relive the excitement and fill in a great deal of blanks about what happened behind the scenes.Sam's next film should be out soon: Global Metal. I look forward to that one as well. The more music documentaries the better!!!!
