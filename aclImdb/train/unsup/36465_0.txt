Sody pop and hot rods and teen lingo. This is definitely a movie out of the 50s.No snakes or dinosaurs or alligators, but a giant gila monster snaking on delicious people.Sheriff Jeff (Fred Graham) is at a loss and the town bigwig (Bob Thompson) is on his case. But, there is one teen (Don Sullivan) around that seems to have the knowledge and gumption to do something.For his first two films Ken Curtis ("Gunsmoke") calls on special effects whiz Ray Kellogg (The Green Berets, The Killer Shrews) to direct his own story.Not a bad tale for the time.
