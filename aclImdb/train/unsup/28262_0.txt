I had not read the book that this was based on. There was even a sense that this would be a waste of time. I realized I was very wrong. As others have mentioned in their comments: this is no Hollywood canon fodder intended for the spoon-fed masses.Some interest in mathematics or science is not essential but more than likely contributes to ones viewing of the film.I found the story very thoughtful and entertaining at the same time. The film is well executed and easy to watch. (Two dimensional characters do not have facial Tiks - just my thoughts)
