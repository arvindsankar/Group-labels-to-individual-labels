Michael and Mark Polish have created a truly heartwarming film. I sat glued to the TV as I watched this video. My heart sank when ignorant folks would stare or respond to the twins as though they didn't already know they were different than the rest of the world. Or when folks wanted to use them to get rich.Seeing the love between the two brothers was so touching I had to get out a box of tissues when it came time for the surgeons to separate them.Michele Hicks, her performance was awesome. She portrayed a true friend to both Blake and Frances, and a beautiful lover to Blake.Lesley Ann Warren - what can I say - you were magnificent. Your performance as the mother who was haunted by giving up her children was heartbreaking. Making amends is not always easy and in the case of your character, a very difficult scene to act.To the rest of the cast - I don't have enough room to write - you were all great!I give this movie a 10. It deserves more, but that's the highest I can vote.Thank you Michael and Mark Polish and all of the other actors, actresses, producers, directors, special effects, make-up artists, musicians, etc. that created one of the centuries best films.
