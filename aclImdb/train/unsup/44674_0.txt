A not very-original story of two young people who fall in love and go through pretty much the exact same things all young couples deal with in real life or the movies. The dialog is trite and, dare I say it again, unoriginal. Cutesy devices -- like the narration, like the characters addressing the camera (Fourth Wall! We Need You!) are overdone, badly done, and grating. Amateurish in every respect.Why a 3? The secondaries -- the Orson Welles-like guy, the Selma Blair porn star girl, Freddie's roommate, and the pot girl. How about a movie about these people, instead of the cookie-cutter romcom leads (yawn).Watch out for Ashton Kutcher as Jim Morrison. Seriously.
