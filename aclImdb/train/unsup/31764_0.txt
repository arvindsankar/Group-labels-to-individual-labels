I went into this movie thinking I knew what was going to happen. I was expecting just another Lindsay Lohan "cute" film.I was wrong on both counts.I had no idea what was going to happen. I was continually surprised and that in itself is surprising. I'm usually really good at figuring out an ending.This was not a cute movie. I was disgusted, I yelled, I screamed, I covered my eyes with my hands. Lindsay wasn't cute, she was very naughty.This is an original, well written, well directed, well acted film.It's silly that some people are saying they don't like the movie because they weren't impressed with her strip dancing. That's hardly the point of the movie. You don't need to find Lindsay attractive to enjoy this movie.The acting was great. I have always enjoyed Julia Ormond's performances. She delivers here and is awesome as the distraught mother. Lindsay, for all her personal issues, is still a really good actress. And I've seen Neal McDonough in a few things recently and he's impressed me.My advice, don't listen to all the nonsense out there right now because people are negative on Lindsay due to her bad press. This is a good movie that doesn't deserved to be trashed.
