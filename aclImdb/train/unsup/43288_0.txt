Breathtakingly, stunningly bad. Production values seem to be even lower than the average adult movie.Total acting skills displayed by all participants: close to zero. Poor shooting, directing, editing, script, DVD transfer, etc. If anybody connected with this movie was paid more than bus fares and lunch money, they were overpaid.Some movies are bad, but entertaining because they are bad. Not so with this turkey.The only reason I gave it one star is because there isn't a zero-star voting option.
