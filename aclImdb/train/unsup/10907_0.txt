glad to see here that I'm not the only one already hooked after just 3 episodes.I've tried to explain to people why they must watch it, but the only way they will understand is to watch it!Its hilarious: terrible acting, atrocious script, wobbly sets, appalling dubbing, and some very alarming wigs.And lots of slow motion (well, its hard to fill a half hour slot with story all the time)I'm looking forward to saying 'I told you so' to lots of people when they 'discover' this show in 6 months!
