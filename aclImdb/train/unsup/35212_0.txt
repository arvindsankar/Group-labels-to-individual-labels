this film is so bad i find it hard to describe to other people, so I end up showing them leaving them speechless! I have seen this awful film far to many times now.it has no relevance to the first one. NOT EVEN ANY TROLLS TO BE SEEN. JUST GOBLINSBad cast, acting, plot, effects just everything.you Will have to watch this for yourself to truly believe that a film like this can be made by people over the age of two.However saying all this it is strangely watchable for its sheer awfulness
