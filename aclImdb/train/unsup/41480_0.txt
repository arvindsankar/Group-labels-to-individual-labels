I not only saw the film,but worked on it as well and had a small role in it,JHS39 is correct in his review.From day one of filming one knew how horrible this film would turn out to be.Not only is it a waste of funds,but talent such as Scott Glenn,Raymond Cruz and Constance Marie.I will not go into details,but let's just say Scott was one really mad actor,and I cannot blame him do to the unprofessional style of work Mike Kirton the director displayed throughout the month of filming.Waste of $1mil!
