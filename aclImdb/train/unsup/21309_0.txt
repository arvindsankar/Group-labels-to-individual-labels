I fully understand that people who read the book don't appreciate this movie, I believe it's true for 90 % of book adaptations.Anyway, it's the sort of movie I like, clean, all scenes are meaningful, Harisson plays the cool fish, but he's the extreme of the heroism played by Dafoe.Fun part of this movie is how the computer kid solved the password in 5 seconds during the first part of the movie, while he was given all the personal "paper" data on the people involved and then was challenged with a serious job at the end. The voice recognition session made me laugh too.Why don't we have these sort of programs at home? Anyway, good action, entertainment, swift changes, it's never dull. Open a bottle of Muscadet, nicely cooled, sit back and enjoy.
