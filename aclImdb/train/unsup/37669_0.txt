Truly dreadful, slow, boring. Couldn't care less about the characters or the (nonexistent) plot. You must have read the Gibson short story to have any clue what your emotions should be.Zero special effects, zero character development, zero cinematography, zero interesting anything (well, nude Asia Argento was okay). And the last act simply rehashes the dreck you've already experienced.This thing looks like a film made by a 14 year old on his Mac. It makes Johnny Mnenonic look like Lawrence of Arabia. How *did* this "movie" get made?At least there was one laugh: the shaky image projected onto a palm pilot, trying to make it look like some future device. Was that really supposed to be believable? Sheesh.Stay away.
