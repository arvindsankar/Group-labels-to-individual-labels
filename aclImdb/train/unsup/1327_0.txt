After reading the enthusiastic comments posted so far, I feel guilty admitting I was bitterly disappointed by "Vengo." I'd enjoyed "Latcho Drom" and even went out and purchased the sound-track CD.But "Vengo" left me cold: too much mediocre acting, far too much melodrama, and far too little flamenco for my taste. At one point the main character characterizes the music being played as "flamenco puro!" and bangs his fist on the cafe table to underscore his fervor. I agreed with him--at that moment. But aside from that one cafe scene, I found little in the movie that seemed "puro" to me, and much that sounded "globalized" and tawdry.I am voting only two stars on this one.
