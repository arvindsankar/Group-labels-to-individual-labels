I watched this movie and was disappointed in the end when Vic was seen as a bad cop and Colleen went off in the sunset with the guy who really is not a good person in all.It should have been that Vic was undercover and he was the one who went off with the girl not the other way around.The ending was not what I expected in this movie especially with Rob Stewart and Hilary Swank.It could have been written better and the ending also should have been different.Rob Stewart has a fan following and I'm sure they were not happy with the role he picked.I know some of his future roles are much better hopefully he gets a lead part again in a TV series.
