And I'm thinking of MST3K and Joe-Bob Briggs. How they would love this movie! Yes, it's really, REALLY bad. I think even Joe-Bob would NOT put this movie on his top 10 list. But, somehow, it grabs you.If you like a lot of moaning, groaning, grunting, screaming, squealing, shrieking women, then you'll love this movie. It appears to be a lame attempt at soft-core porn, without the flesh. Like female wrestling? You'll love this movie.Like proto-Bruce Lee martial arts? You'll love this movie.Like trying to lip-read the actors' lines? You'll love this movie.The only thing missing is Adrienne Barbeau (sp?)I'd recommend being in a "certain state of mind" before watching this flick. But, if you do, I guarantee that you'll have a night to remember! It's like Woody Allen's "What's Up, Tiger Lily?" without the cachet of Woody Allen!I give it a 10 simply for its awfulness, and yet...sooooo hypnotic....
