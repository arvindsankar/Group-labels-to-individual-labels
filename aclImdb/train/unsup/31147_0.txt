If you know what you are getting into, you'll enjoy this. Sick,perverted, twisted, cheesy and funny. One of the best independent horror flicks I've seen in a long time. Many recent "B-films" decide to show everything from the start, this film has the balls to develop the character, to take its time, I kind of liked that. Matt nelson is dead on balls perfect for the character, Kevin O'Neil is hysterical and newcomer Tara Cardinal brings some heart into this sick film. Even though the special effects are cheesy (as expected with this budget), the cinematography is great, good angles, a clear effort to create a "bigger"looking picture, with scenes that look so close to film that one forgets we are seeing a DV 24p project. Very good effort.
