I did not know what to expect when I picked up this DVD. But, I have to admit it held my attention from beginning to end...and boy was the ending a shocker! I don't know if the ending will work for most, but for me it did. The music was very intense and scary as well (I had to buy the soundtrack, it's great for Halloween) Any way, I really liked it and the special features are cool too. For me however, besides the surprise ending and the shocking murder mystery plot twists, what I love the most about this movie is the title...BLEEDING ROSE, ooh nice:)
