I rated this one a little high because of the nice scenery. At least this movie wasn't filmed on a set with painted backgrounds.I've always enjoyed films involving time travel. Some time travel flicks are exciting. A few, like BACK TO THE FUTURE (all three) border on being comical. So eventually, somebody had to make a time travel flick that is boring, and here it is, THE NEXT ONE.This movie has a list of cinematic giants. But in this movie, the giants take a fall.There are a few special effects, like the electrical storm.But this movie, at its high points, drags. Then, it's downhill.This movie sits in my collection, waiting to be used as a door stop. A real disappointment.
