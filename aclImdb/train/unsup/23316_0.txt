this is one of the stupidest movies i've ever seen - so unrealistic. puts a bad name to new-york. just really awful plot.it's about twins Roxy and Jane, one is smart, and the other is a smart-ass. after their mom died, they kind of grew apart. the movie is really bad, not an ounch of realism. they make a city like new-york, who's larger then life, like it's the smallest city with just 10 people. anyway - u don't wanna watch this.i cant wait for this 2 actresses to finally shoot a serious movie, with a serious plot, not childish.
