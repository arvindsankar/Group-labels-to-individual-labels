this is the most impressive holocaust movie ever, If you have ever seen Shoa you'll agree .....may you not be familiar with the ongoing events back in the 1940's in the death-camps maybe you should read into it before seeing this filmit's not like Uprising or Schindler's list (I haven't seen the Pianist yet but I very much doubt it'll come close)this is the real stuff .....MUST SEE 5 out of 5
