Mad Max meets the Dragons.What a silly waste of film. A decent idea with a horrid film attached. And they could have saved a lot of money using B&W film; the rare color of note is only the flames. Grey, blue and black are poor tools. Maybe it's supposed to remind us of old WWII films?The Disney version will probably be better.A study in why simply adding fire and big booms to a movie is not enough.And why, when in species danger, do humans have to dress up as medieval persons?Christian Bale should have quit at 15 and become a tax collector, duller than the sharp end of an egg.Don't pay for it, wait for it on Mystery Theater 3000.
