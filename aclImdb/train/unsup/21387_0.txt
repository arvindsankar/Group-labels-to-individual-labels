Despite its length (more than a couple of hours) the story did not find a direction; instead, you are offered to taste the characters in such manner you are forced to hate the bad guys and love the good ones.Many aspects of the film were definitely brilliant: the sceneries for Mexico in the early 1900s and the script, which seemed to be carefully written to exclude any neologism and include those seasonal slang.Screenplay, from time to time, shows a clear influence of Emilio `El Indio' Guzman and Ismael Rodr√≠guez.A bit silly but very amusing.
