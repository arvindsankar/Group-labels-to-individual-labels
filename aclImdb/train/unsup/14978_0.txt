What members of the Bush administration said. Why it was all false.Lots of words about weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons, biological weapons, chemical weapons, grave threats, and Al-Qaeda. Nothing about concern or freedom for the Iraqi people, something that came stage center only after the other reasons for the war were exposed as bald-faced lies.Oscars to Mr. Bush and Mr. Powell for superior acting (lying in a most convincing fashion) and to Mr. Rumsfeld for a chameleonic performance (changing as the story changed).This is a film every American and Briton should watch.
