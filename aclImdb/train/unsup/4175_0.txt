How horror should be.I was fortunate enough to view this prior to The Call of Cthulhu at the Leeds Film Festival in 2006 and to be honest, Oculus was better.Goes to show that you don't need masses of blood and gore and elaborate sets to produce chilling horror.I found myself holding my breath on more than one occasion as well as looking for a non-existent cushion to hide behind!That's how good it is!The acting was brilliant and it was really well written - the story will appeal to any fan that loves a spine-chiller.Looking forward to other instalments and hoping to get this on DVD someday.
