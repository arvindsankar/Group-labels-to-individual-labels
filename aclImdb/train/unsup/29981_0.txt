Blah... Blah Blah Blah... Blah Blah Blaaaaa....!This film is so boring that It makes Groundhog Day appear realistic and interesting. Blah Blah...Bitch Bitch Bitch about random people who will never make a difference and spend thirty seconds deciding on what words you are going to respond with so they sound smart.What's with the top hats? Is it 1932 or 1990?I grew up in this neighborhood and believe me, this film is a load of s**t.Yeah, woo hoof... They used real apartments. Well, the taste of the apartments is that of a drunk white trash bible thumper that stole the coin jar from their local church... Ew!I think this is the first film I have seen where they didn't purposely cast a homo.I think fire crotch is going to be serial killer...And now.. I have witnessed the flooding of St. Pats.I'm out, and destroying this DVD...
