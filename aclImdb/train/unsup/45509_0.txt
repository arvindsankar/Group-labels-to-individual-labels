Actually, I didn't have high hopes for this film. Usually when a film stars a professional wrestler, more often than not it is going to be junk. These guys aren't just that good of actors.This one, however, was a little better than most.First, it truly ridicules the awful cultural phenomenon known as "reality television".Secondly, it has some interesting moments. The scenes where the producers of the show actually start to have reservations about what they are doing. The scenes where Austin tries to act with some humanity when everyone else around him is murdering with impunity.It's not Shakespeare. It's not Lawrence Olivier. It is good entertainment for a few hours.There were some parts where I thought were stupid, like giving the ankle bracelets 10 second fuses, allowing someone to pull the pin on an adversary and kill him/her ten seconds later. Or the black guy (characer names are hardly worth remembering) who says he will never trust another woman and then realizes the female contestant just pulled his suicide pin while she runs away.
