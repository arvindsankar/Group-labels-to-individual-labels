I was really looking forward to this being a fan of Cary Grant, Irene Dunne and screwball comedies, but I was very disappointed.My main concern was the dismal treatment of Gail Patrick's character (Bianca). It wasn't her fault that Irene Dunne (Ellen) wasn't dead yet she is treated so rudely and offhandedly that I found it irritating and frustrating.In addition it often simply wasn't funny.Don't waste your time on this, watch and watch again "The Awful Truth" starring the same pair instead, and contrast the treatment of Ralph Bellamy's character with that of Patrick's.
