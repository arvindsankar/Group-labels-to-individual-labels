Shelly Long is an excellent comedic actress who has excruciatingly terrible taste in choosing films. Watching her on Cheers is a joy. She has perfect comedy timing and is at her best as an intellectual in a company of clowns.BUT she should NOT be cast as the clown! In her movie career she pulled a "Chevy Chase" and spiraled down from an attractive bright person to a buffoon. Hello Again is the nadir (I hope!).Where do I start? The writer, Susan Issacs, must be somebody's niece. She is a rotten writer. Making Lucy's character a stumble bum is pointless. Why? Who would think the constant pratfalls are funny?? It is embarrassing to watch.Judith Ivey should get the ham of the year award for drastic overacting. Gabriel Byrnes is wonderful. I had not seen him before, but seeing how he could even pretend to be in character in this turkey was impressive. And I liked Corbin B.I watch this movie to cheer myself up. No matter how bad things are in my life, at least I didn't appear in this film.
