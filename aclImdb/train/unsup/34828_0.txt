Adolescent, uninspired movie about a girl who is dying and decides to buy things, kiss girls, and become unbearably shrill.There's no sense of reality here. Seriously, this movie makes the television programme "Friends" look gritty. We've seen this all before SO MANY TIMES. Not a note of originality in the tinny, clich√©-ridden screenplay. Pretentious? This movie is so self-important it's almost sickening. It's a lame, boring artistic failure. Some of the supporting roles are well cast. I wish Ms. Redford more luck next time.
