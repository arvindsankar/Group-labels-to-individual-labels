Pure and simple, as a computer nerd this movie is crap.It is totally 100% unbelievable, thats about it. It plays on every single hacker stereotype that exists and it makes up laws of technology."HEY! I bet I can guess the password to the FBI in 3 tries! I bet it's sex secret or god!"Thats the level of technology they expect us to believe the FBI uses.They ALSO expect us to believe that the FBI keeps its top secret files ONLINE in the first place!!Crap, all the way through, plain and simple.
