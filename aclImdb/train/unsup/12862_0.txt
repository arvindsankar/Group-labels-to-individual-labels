Amazingly good, in the mould of a classic western, with Sanjay Dutt, who is maybe one of the best actors period. He is up there with Pacino, Bachchan, Brando, etc. Nandita Das stood out, playing Dutt's wife, in a very powerful performance. I enjoyed the slow build up to the climax of the film; Puri in one of his best "bad guy" roles was also great. .. One warning, I had to buy this DVD three times. Both previous copies by Spark, where defective and would not play past the 70-minute mark.Highly recommended.
