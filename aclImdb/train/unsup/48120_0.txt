One star is the lowest I can give this film, but it deserves a second star simply because it got made and turned out to be a whole movie.Unlike many C-movies, this movie actually used extras and has some scenes set in public streets. It doesn't all take place in somebody's basement or in the woods behind the director's house. There are also some OK special effects, including several beheadings. On the other hand, it's a terrible movie.If you want to watch a Bookwalter movie and stay awake, give Polymorph a chance. It's a much cheaper movie, but the story is actually sort of interesting.Avoid The Dead Next Door.
