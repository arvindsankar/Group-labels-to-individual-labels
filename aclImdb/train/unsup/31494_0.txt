A timeless classic. Full marks to the director and the cast.Hrithik is perfection personified as usual. This would be Ash's best performance till date as she does not giggle needlessly or overact at any point.The supporting cast has done a great job too - especially Punam Sinha and Nikitin. A slight regret is that Sonu Sood should have had a stronger personality for his background, but it is does not impact the movie in any way. The music is endearing. It will catch up on you as you listen to it a couple of times.Avoid watching pirated online versions and go watch it in a theater. A pirated version simply cannot capture the grandeur of this movie.
