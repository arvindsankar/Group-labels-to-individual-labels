I felt like I was...stuck in traffic. Hard to sit through. As much as youare not supposed to like Ben Affleck's character, his acting is flattoo. His character has not depth and either does his performance.Hmm, which came first...chicken or egg here? The story idea isgreat, but it does not clip along at a good pace like a story takingplace in a day like this one should to feel right. I could not sitthrough this movie. I left almost at the predictable end and got alatte.
