Comically bad.I watched it for the "Louis Gosset Jr." scene but I didn't get to see it.Otherwise I would have given it a 3.The LGJ-Scene is like in Iron Eagle I and Toy Soldiers where there's some kid who's in waaaaaay over his head and the guys in charge are about to give up, but then LGJ says..."This kid is different! I believe in him! He can be trusted to take on terrorists OR fly a billion-dollar jet into enemy territory, you got to trust me!" and sure enough, he always sways their opinion.The 80's rocked.
