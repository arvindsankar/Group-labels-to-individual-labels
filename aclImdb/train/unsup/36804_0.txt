Once again, Hollywood, or a counter part depicts history through the eyes of the camera.The portrayl of the Inspector is so far from the truth, it is absurbed!!The physician to the royal family was never seriously considered as a suspect. Prince Albert never fathered a child from a prostitute.The real killer was a man by the name of James Maybrick.
