As a big fan of indie and low budget horror, I've seen some poor acting in my day, but this one may take the cake. I think the cast knew what they had gotten themselves into and stopped trying after the read through.Basically, this film commits the cardinal triple sin of the indie horror world: The script is stupid, its boring, and its not at all scary.I'm one of those people who feels he is required to sit all the way through any movie, but this one tempted me to bail out like no other movie I've seen recently. I did make it though, barely.As for the people who are comparing this to Blair Witch, why? The two films have nothing in common at all, other than having a scene or two take place in the woods.Save your rental money....or go rent Session 9, May, or Ginger Snaps instead.Rating 1 of 10.
