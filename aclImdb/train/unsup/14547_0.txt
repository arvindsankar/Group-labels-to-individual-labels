This is a Great Movie which I got to see in 1990 from a Laser disc we rented.This also gives us an idea about the origins of Snoopy and his original owner Leila.The soundtrack is also great.I watched this movie with my niece and nephew who enjoyed it much as I did back then.I liked the part when Charlie Brown said "It took that rock 5,000 years to come to shore, now your putting it back".This is a movie which can be enjoyed by the family.It takes me to an earlier time of innocence.I wish things were a lot simpler now as it was then.
