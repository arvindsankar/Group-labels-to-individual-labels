the title says it all, "I am the Cheese". This movie is nothing but cheesy.The movie makes no sense at all for those who haven't read the book, it makes a little sense to those who have read the book.The acting is terrible, the character lacked charisma it's almost like they are reading from a script.And last of all, the movie is boring, they are good boring movies like " lost in Translation" etc. This movie is everything you don't want you movie to be.Anyway, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It's the ultimate embarrassment if anyone catch you watching this. The book is a worth read but STAY AWAY FORM THIS
