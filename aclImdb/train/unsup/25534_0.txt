The summary line says it all.Bogie as a kinda sexy guy, a la Casablanca, at first, but becoming more unhinged as time passes. (And a great nod to Casablanca's closing line.)An English country house with tea parties and hybrid rose gardens. Snooty neighbors and an eccentric housekeeper. A parish church with bells that chime at propitious moments. A glowing glass of poisoned milk (although not a glowy as in Suspicion).Kind of a fun movie, as it turns out.
