I have seen this show when I was growing up and I liked it very muchHere in my country, the most of TV series of America came in under some format almost without any delay since decades ago.It is clear that this formula has been reproduced many times but I like the acting freshness, the connection with the characters, and of course the equipment they use in the rescues (who doesn't dream about a bronco)Well, I hope the DVD industry take care soon about the not so popular shows and release it quickly.PS: I loved the soundtrack
