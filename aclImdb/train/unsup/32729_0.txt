Well, I know about Hitler and all the bad things that Germany did at WWII.But still, I don't understand, why 60 years after-wards, we still have to suffer by having awful German cinema ! (I do like some Fassbinder films)Why are there only films about Hitler/DDR or these empty theater films for bored bank-workers?Why only these "Quality Films"? Films that imitate the "Good Taste" of the past? Films that imitate the film language of Bresson, only taking out the content and the originality he had?God, please help Germany.Give us ART! no more Endless Restorations of the past!
