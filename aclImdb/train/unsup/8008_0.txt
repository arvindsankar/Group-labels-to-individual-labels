With the filming of Naughty But Nice, Dick Powell ended his contract with Warner Brothers and never set foot on that lot again. He wanted desperately to do dramatic material and Warners gave him nothing but lightweight stuff. It would be another four years before he was able to convince someone to cast him in drama and RKO got a genuine hit in Murder My Sweet when they did.Powell plays a sheltered music professor at a very snobby college who's been raised by three maiden aunts. The character is obviously ripped off from Cary Grant's paleontology professor in Bringing Up Baby. He's written a concerto, but music publisher Ronald Reagan sees some popular tune in it and publishes it as such.Powell than becomes the object of singer Ann Sheridan's and lyric writer Gale Page's romantic and business desires. The fun is seeing who he winds up with.Harry Warren and Al Dubin who wrote some really great songs for Dick Powell in those Busby Berkeley films write absolutely nothing of consequence here. In any event Powell wanted desperately out of musicals.Especially stuff like this.
