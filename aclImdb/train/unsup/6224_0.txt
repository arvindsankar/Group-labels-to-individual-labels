Tears of joy and tears of anguish.You'll have both with this movie as it takes you on a roller coaster of emotional highs and lows.Rent the DVD and you will be enthralled with scenes of the original Calendar Girls who made the whole thing possible.The Yorkshire scenery is very beautiful, they don't show quite as much rain as you'd get in Yorkshire, but that's movies for you!While Julie Walters and Helen Mirren play the two 'title roles' I hope you join me in enjoying the pianist who has obviously had a chequered past and is a hoot.I hope this movie spawns many more 'calendars' that will help cancer research. What a great epitaph for John, the cancer victim in this movie who's humor inspired the ladies to do what they did.Best movie for ages.JP
