This film tries to use "funky" camera angles & special effects to hide a terrible plot & rather uninteresting characters.Completely lacking in atmosphere, a must for a good horror, this was so tedious I switch off half way through. Luckily I didn't fork out good money for this drivel as it was on cable TV when i saw it.Avoid 2/10.
