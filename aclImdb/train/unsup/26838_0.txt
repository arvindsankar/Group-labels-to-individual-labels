Peter Jackson and Costa Boeates decided to make this great mockumentary about a man called Colin McKenzie, a man who invented such things as color film, audio film and above all, made the first full length feature movie.Apparently it was quite a successful hoax in New Zealand, people really did buy it. And I really can't blame them, as most of the fabricated film material really looks like almost hundred years old, almost destroyed film.And there are some very convincing famous film people, like Sam Neil, telling their knowledge of this McKenzie.Even the tone of the film isn't actually very funny, even thought there are some things in it that are so absurd, that they make you laugh.Over all well made mockumentary.
