For some reason, people seem to have a problem differentiating this movie from Trail of the Pink Panther.At any rate, this work does nothing but serve to remind us how sad the world is without Peter Sellers in it.They brought back the same old favorites from Trail (Dreyfus, Cato, Litton, etc.), but they introduced a misdirected Pratt-fall humorist into a role which was designed to substitute for the missing Clouseau. Dreyfus devises a way to produce the perfect copy of Clouseau via a hard frame computer system which factors the variables and tosses out the name of the most inept idiot in the global law enforcement family. What we got was a poor guy who was obviously overwhelmed by the grand scale of what Blake Edwards proposed he should do, and boy does it show.Ted Wass was amiable as Sergeant Clifton Sleigh, but let's face it...he wasn't Clouseau in any way. I realize that Blake Edwards was losing his greatest cash cow, but to disrespect Sellers' memory like this was just sacrilege. Frankly, I'm glad they have remade the original. I hope it runs a long line of successful ventures for Steve Martin.This dreck rates a 2.0/10 from...the Fiend :.
