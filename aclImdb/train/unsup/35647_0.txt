Matlock...the answer to everything that is wrong with old people's TV shows.Like MURDER SHE WROTE, this comes off as some insane idea that old people with white hair have the solution to all the murders that happen and can solve any crime with little or no evidence; but rather just by talking their way to a solution with nothing to substantiate the story.It's horrible.The script formula is always the same, the characters might as well be the same in each episode, because the story doesn't fluctuate.And the guy works for free, no matter who hires him, because he never gets paid or if people do offer to pay him, he doesn't accept the money for whatever reason and gives it back.The only good episodes where when Don Knotts came on - because he naturally is great.Don't be fooled by the friendly Andy Griffith, the show is really retarded when you look at it away from the TV screen.
