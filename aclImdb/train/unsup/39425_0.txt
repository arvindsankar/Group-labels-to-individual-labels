i live in Ireland and had been looking forward seeing this for up to a year. i thought it was a so called "movie" movie but it wasn't so i kept looking into it and thought it would be funny and entertainingand then when watching it recently i was excited and then watching it i was shocked by its stupidityboring jokes, unfunny views and Andy Milonokas. it was crapi loved (most of) the cast and thought they would make it, not even funny per se but entertaining.the only good bits were with Matthew Lillardi would not recommend this film to anyone with as brain or pulse and it was a waist of 75 minutes and 29 seconds of mi life1*/10*: unbelievably poor
