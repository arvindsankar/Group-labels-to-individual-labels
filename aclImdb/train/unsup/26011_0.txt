Question; who would be interested in seeing a movie called "Hollow Man II"? Answer; those who enjoyed Hollow Man I Question; Who is Hollow Man II aimed at? Answer; that's more of a mystery.I suppose someone who liked Hollow Man enough to watch a sequel, but who hated the special effects, the sex, the violence, the science, the interesting subplots like the relationship between Bacon and Shue, the characterization, and who just liked the bit at the end which was basically a chase sequence through a tunnel. They made the same mistake with "Batman and robin", it just wasn't aimed at the same audience who liked the first Batman movie. Paul Verhoven himself said, "If he is JUST invisible, okay, then forget the whole movie" If anyone at Sony is reading this I'll say it again;"If he is JUST invisible, okay, then forget the whole movie"What he meant was that there's no point in just having Kevin Bacon be a voice over. He has to actually be visible somehow; plugs, water, blanket, plastic mask, blood splatter, smoke, etc. In Hollow Man II you see exactly why Paul Verhoven said that.
