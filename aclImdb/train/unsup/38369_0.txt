This is a pretty poor film. An overt enthusiasm for poor lighting (no, everything in high contrast red, or black& white isn't clever, its just difficult to watch). A slooooooow script (not a aged wine, but a bottle of gone-off alco-pop) A script that makes no sense. The twist (of which about 3 tolerable ones were discarded for the most inconsistent). Don't waste your money or your time.***SPOILER***He goes back from the past to stop himself falling in love with a beautiful woman, who'll make him rich, but due to his own stupidity, tells himself she's bad and gets him burnt (and still gets the girl, the love and the money !!) If he'd had said, done stand near the caravan he'd have been OK. Oh, and he makes a girl kill her boyfriend and Aleister Crowley think he's a magician (those last bits tagged on to be 'clever').Its "Donnie Darko" / Butterfly effect, but without a coherent script. A real wasted opportunity.
