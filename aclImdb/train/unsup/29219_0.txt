This film has got to be one of the worst sequels ever produced. The plot line was poor, confusing and the ending was really unclear. Characters who were in it just disappeared without any fuss. No where near as good as number one. This sequel goes down in flop history with:Grease 2 & Dirty Dancing 2 Classics having their names ruined with producers who make one film to many!I just wondering if any of the people who have written reviews have actually seen the film??Total waste of money. I wouldn't recommend it at all!!!
