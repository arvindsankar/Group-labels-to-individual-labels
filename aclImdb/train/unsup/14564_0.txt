I saw the Lost World Jurassic Park twice at the movies.And this is one of the first games I ever played on the Playstation One.Good movie but the game was just a total boredom.The first of the game has you be a small Dinosaur and you take on Dinosaurs bigger then you.How smart was that? But to be fair the games didn't look too bad and the sounds was good too.But with bad controllers and bad game play hurts this game a lot.Also this game is too hard to have any fun.I say this was one of the worst games ever made and it why some games based of movies are bad.If you want a Video Game based on the Jurassic Park Films then I would suggest Warpath Juassic Park. That's a fun game.I give The Lost World Juassic Park a 3 out of 10.Good movie bad game.
