I have to wonder what movie some of these other reviewers watched.This story in this movie was terrible, actually confusing Bigfoot with werewolves. One bit of dialog for the purpose of exposition was a wooden little piece where a deputy tells the sheriff, (para-phrased) "Must be the beast of Bray Road. A monster in the 1800s wiped out everyone out there." "Is this true?" asks the sheriff."Oh, absolutely" confirms a nearby nurse. ROFL Its not quite funny bad, just bad and wooden.I have to admit that I didn't watch this entire movie. It chased me off soon after the wretched conversation just recounted. Save yourself and watch a Murder She Wrote rerun instead. LOL
