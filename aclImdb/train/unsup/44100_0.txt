Waste of time! IF the movie was made by a High School Drama Team... then OK... good work. Otherwise, this stinksJust like all the other "Mini Movies"... which are put together in haste... Token Asian "brain" guy Token female "hero" chick Token White "bad" guy Token military "evil" guy Token politician "cover-up" guy Token teenage "couple in love" pairTypical small town Typical... "this is going to end it all for the world" themeBad acting, bad casting, and VERY BAD research...The USAF logo... is a RECRUITING logo for the USAFThere are NO 4-Star Generals except in time of war!Why have a camouflaged business jet for the "General"? Is he going to land that thing in Iraq? Where did that response team come from so fast? No-town Utah is suppose to be in the middle of nowhere! Oh... that's right, they were dropped out of the government sponsored UFO!Since when has ANY "First Lady" looked that good?And from the very start I just knew that someone would suggest "nuking" the town... which they did suggest. That is how predictable this waste of time is!Again... if it was done by a bunch of High School drama students... then great! You have some imagination. But if I paid to have a ad during the movie... I would demand a refund!Speaking of ads.... Ford actually did an ad during the movie based on the movie... I will never buy a Ford!
