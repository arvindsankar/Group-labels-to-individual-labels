This movie made me cringe in my seat and at times I was forced to look away... but not for the reasons the filmmakers intended.Disgusting and pathetic acting topped with the most stupid story and direction by an idiot.Hated every millisecond of it.At times I thought the writers had supernatural powers...When the main 'thing' (I wont disgrace anyone and use the term actor) starts ranting 'Someone help me!' I was taken aback as that is exactly what I was thinking at the time.When they discover an old newspaper that reports the closure of the asylum they are in and she quips 'This doesn't make any sense' I could only agree.If there is a film god, then everyone on the project will never work again. I'm hoping the reaper gets them.Amateurish rubbish at its finest! Just who slept with who to give this crap of a production the green light.
