The best of the entire series is here.Jason has returned, but is shot down with a vengeance by a large police force. After he is blown to body parts, it seems that the maniacal Jason is finally dead.But he's not. The only way that Jason can return is by gaining a new body, and he does this immediately, jumping from body to body, killing person after person, ruining life after life.The final death of Jason is here at long, long last, and, as unexpected, requires a visit to his old childhood home.I'll say, this is the only sequel in the entire series that is ACTUALLY scary. It's a wonderful horror film, and defeats ALL of the series, INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL, by a really, REALLY long shot.(It even sparks the beginning of Freddy VS. Jason... Hmmm...)
