It's always sunny meets the office set in a grocery store.I can just imagine the pitch meeting for this. Ugh.Weak concept, weak dialog, weak acting.I don't know where to begin.I know where I can end-by not watching it ever again.Fortunately I just stumbled on to this.Moreso than not recommending it, this show reminded me that I should find more to do in the evenings.Ugh. Did I mention that already? I mean, I just don't know how to describe it. Also, I am flummoxed that it is the same name as a quality movie starring Morgan Freeman. The two titles are not related.Ugh. Sorry for repeating myself. The actor who plays Leslie Best acts a bit caveman-ish. Tongue firmly in cheek.
