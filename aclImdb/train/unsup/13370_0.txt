I disagree with the other person's comments.I found this film to be one-sided (i.e propaganda) in its portrayal of a Mormon missionary.Which is fine, but just boring for a movie.Sorry the other person seems to have a chip on his/her shoulder in defending this movie.But I found it sugar-coated while avoiding some deeper issues - like what is the traditional spirituality of these people that the Mormon missionary was replacing.The movie glorifies religious colonialism - so if that bothers you, you may not want to waste your time on this movie.However, if you want to learn how the narcissism of missionaries and religious zealots works, it's a good example.
