But I just didn't. Perhaps I'd read one too many okay reviews, but I had such high hopes for this after High Art, that I found it a little, well, disappointing.Fascinating, but disappointing.I'm the biggest Fraces McDormand fan out there, she's ALWAYS great ineverything she does, and she pretty much held my attention here as well. If the story had been more hers, it would've really set sail, but there's a plot about her son (Christian Bale, American Pyscho and Little Women) and his fiance (KateBeckinsdale, Pearl Harbor) that just doesn't work. Perhaps it's all the oddaccents- Bale is a brit doing a 'new yawk' accent, Beckinsdale is a brit doing a 'standard American', Natasha McElhone (Truman Show) is a brit doing anindecipherable middle eastern accent, and Allesandra Nivola (Face Off) is anAmerican doing a British accent. Phew.If you sense something a little 'odd' during this movie, it's that every sentence feels inauthentic, because there are certain words that all the actors doingaccents simply can't pronounce that well. It seems picky, but it has thecumulative effect of feeling like you're watching a school play, and it takes you out of the story.The story, by the way, has a great premise in it. The straight up tight son coming to stay with his promiscuous liberal mother- who seduces his fiance. VeryGreek. I just wish it had delved a little deeper, and that Bale and Beckinsdale were either more fully developed characters, or in the film less.But I have to say, it was worth seeing for Frances McDormand alone. She really lights up a screen whenever she's given a chance. I'd give this a 6 out of 10.
