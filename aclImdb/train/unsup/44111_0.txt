While lifting various plot elements from the original (nasty virus, Wildfire containment facility, odd-man-out auto-destruct canceler, etc) we get a whole pile of additional elements thrown in, and for no apparent good reason.Ben Bratt's character has a substance abusing wife and an estranged son...this goes no where.The Wildfire team is now composed of a more politically correct team including a black, an Asian, and a homosexual.Wormhole? Virus sent from the future so we can save ourselves? Somebody's been watching too many Star Trek reruns.The let's-crawl-up-the-central-Wildfire-tube-core sequence in the original was terrific and tension filled. In this remake it is labored and boring. It might have gained another score point if the wrong thumb had been cut off.And then there's Jack Nash running around looking for Grace (oops, wrong series).And then we have all the secret bad government daring-do, a predictable addition in these times.As someone else once said "They should only remake bad movies".You've been warned.
