Most books of movie reviews agree with the other reviewer here, they like it a lot. Well I just saw this movie and I thought it was pretty awful. The incredible cast (Hackman, Lancaster, Windom, Kerr, Bonnie Bedelia, Sheree North) is just wasted. The dialogue is spoken with so many long pauses the movie would be 30% shorter if you edited it to sound like real people talk.And to accept the plot, you must accept these premises:- Professional sky divers are scared every time they go up.- Professional sky divers would risk their lives to pop the chute too low to the ground to give the crowd a thrill.- It's dangerous to jump with a "cape" because you will think you can fly and forget to pull the rip cord.Does any of this sound reasonable to you? I will say this, there are some spectacular aerial photography scenes at the start and end of the movie, and yes Debbie looks great for 48!
