This was one of the best Jet Li films i've seen for some time, and it certainly surpasses Romeo Must Die. The martial arts performed by Jet Li and numerous others were second to none, just the best.As for holes in the storyline, does that matter? the action surpassed the storyline in my opinion.Full 10.
