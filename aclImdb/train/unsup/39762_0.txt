and I don't mean the sulfur coming up through the vents.The plot is as thin as the earth's crust after these dweebs drilled. Any death in this movie is deserved due to the bad acting.The CG effects look cheap and cartoonish, the lame tie-in and obvious shot at the anti-terror task forces are ridiculous.Other than the fact that the city of New York is facing total destruction, I found little of any redeeming value is this laugher.Michael Ironside must really be desperate for money. The dude from Galactica needs to rethink his career choices after being pitched as an overzealous government type.
