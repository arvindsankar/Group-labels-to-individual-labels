Not a very good movie.Van Wilder 2:The Rise of Taj is a movie that almost completely relies on gross out laughs and unfortunately doesn't succeed.There are a only 2 or 3 giggle moments.Some people might be tricked into watching because its called Van Wilder. Don't be fulled ladies and gentlemen Van Wilder isn't even in it.Taj(Kal Penn)leaves college to continue his education he goes to a college in england where he wants to teach a rich bitch student(Lauren Cohen)not to be so serious.The actors did a OK job. That is what kept this movie from getting below 3/10. Kal Penn was funny. I didn't even know Lauren Cohen was in this(i know her from supernatural)but it was a nice surprise.This is not a very funny movie and at most times just plain stupid. The actors are the only thing that make this being worthy of even being called a movie. I don't recommend this. But if you want to watch a Van Wilder movie without Van Wilder in it then go ahead. They should have only called it 'The Rise of Taj'.3/10
