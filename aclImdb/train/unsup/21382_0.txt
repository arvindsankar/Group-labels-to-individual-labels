I saw this a little while ago in the heyday of the "Hong Kong" craze. Me, I'm a purist. I love Woo, Hark, Lam. But this little gem is one that has stayed with me after all these years.Performances and action are leagues above any American action movie in the past 20 years. Hong Kong/China are where the best action movies come from. No wonder America is stealing all their actors and remaking their movies.At times comical. At times James Bond. This Hong Kong working of the plot from "Sneakers" is one that is definitely worth tracking down.10/10
