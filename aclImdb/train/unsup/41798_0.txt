I am going to be brief about this horrifying series, let me begin by stating I am a Christian, so I hold no kind of vendetta against the morals portrayed.Let me explain my feelings about this show in one sentence: This is an awfully acted, horrifically directed, terribly written, atrociously misinformed, horrendously uninspired "series" that deserves to have a warning on it to keep unsuspecting families from renting it.That is my one sentence review, there you have it.NOTE: This series does not reflect what Christians enjoy to watch, quite the contrary really.
