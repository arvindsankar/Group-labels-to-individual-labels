A captivating tale of a couple returning to The Soviet Union, and finding out the trip was not exactly as advertised or promised. Together, they face the reality of Stalinist Russia and the horrors of persecution that reside therein. A very well made film that captures the hearts of its audience, with genuine empathy and intelligence, as opposed to emotional manipulation. Hollywood should take note on how such films like this address their subjects, and the subsequent dialogue. A truly well acted and crafted film. Highly recommended.
