I've seen some bad movies. I've seen some REALLY bad movies.But I wouldn't want to offend the 'Bad' and 'Really Bad' movies by calling MK2 one of them. This movie was truly the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Hollywood.Right off the bat, I knew things were going to suck. The actors had changed into wussy shadows of their MK1 selves. Christopher Lambert, while not being an excellent actor, was still VERY cool in the first Mortal Kombat. I had a bad feeling in the back of my brain when they replaced him with a...well...character that not only looked wimpy, but acted like a fly-swatter.The special defects...uh...special 'effects' in this movie were horrible! I'm not asking for fully rendered, super-resolution 3D "Star Wars Ep 1" environments...just enough technological know-how to make the movie look okay.The poor bastards couldn't even get close to those fairly forgiving expectations.The plot? None. Bad guy suddenly comes back, even though MK1 stated it was over and done with. Characters go and show up like it was a frat party. NOTHING in the movie is worth latching onto for a fun ride.All in all, the only good that came of my watching this movie was the fact I got to see the cool, spooky "Dark City" trailer at the beginning.Don't waste your time. Trust me like you've never trusted anyone else in your life on this.
