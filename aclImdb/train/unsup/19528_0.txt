Jumanji gone terribly wrong! Ohnoes!Go into this movie expecting a low budget, but hopefully creative film. Dialog's pretty funny and original. The acting is primarily very bad, but that's okay.The male actors are in fact so horrible that they cannot even stay in character or hold on to a believable emotion structure for even a few seconds. The girls seem more believable overall.The characters are fun, the dialog is funny, sometimes so bad its fun.I really liked the sundial concept that was pretty cool, more like a moon dial, or egg timer for the dark wiccans of doom! AHH!!!"I thought he was taking me to a spa..." That chick's death was pretty sweet.The movie was very low budget, we knew that, but at least it keeps you wondering what it's all about, which is more then I can say for a lot of other horror movies, which made this movie at least enjoyable.Sadly I think the people who rated this so low did so unforgiving of low budget movies. yes some of the plot and character cohesion was really bad. But conceptually, effect wise, music wise, honesty wise, it was pretty fun and kept me wanting to know what the hell was going to happen.
