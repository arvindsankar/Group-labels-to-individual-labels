I saw this film the year it first hit the theaters.Anything that Cooper did in those days was OK with me.and while this film was fairly typical of the westerns he made during that period, with the exception of "High Noon" which won him an Oscar, it had a darker cast and a sinister undertone that perfectly fit the locations in Mexico where it was filmed. Coop made several films in Mexico, including "Vera Cruz" with Bert Lancaster.All entertaining to watch, but this one I especially liked.It has the standard "coop gets the girl" ending, and some fairly corny mellowdrama, but by and large it was worthwhile, and even, in some ways, memorable.My favorite scene is near the end of the film where Coop and his friends are fleeing from a hoard of Indians along a narrow trail that skirts the side of a mountain (perhaps special effects, perhaps a real place, I've often wondered), and someone has to stay behind to stand them off while the rest make it to safety. Coop, of course, volunteers, but Richard Widmark gets the call. Good shootumup.The supporting case did its job well, and there were even moments when it was believable.Altogether I would recommend it, if you like westerns.
