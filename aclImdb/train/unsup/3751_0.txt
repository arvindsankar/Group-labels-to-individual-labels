The daredevils/heroes are: Gene-- the brains of the outfit, Tiny  a gifted strongman, and Bert -- an agile escape artist. They are aided by Carole Landis who plays Blanche Grandville  the granddaughter of Horace Grandville whose multimillion dollar industrial complex is under attack by master criminal 39013. This film is twelve chapters of action packed cliff-hanging fun. I particularly liked the fact that these circa 1939 daredevils did almost all of their action scenes in double breasted three piece suits! The history of the major actors is quite interesting: Dave Sharpe,Bert, became an Army pilot during WWII and a major stuntman; having a long and celebrated career in the industry. He has been ranked with the great Yakima Canutt. Charles Quigley, Gene, had a good career but died of cirrhosis of the liver before he turned sixty. Bruce Bennet aka Herman Brix, who played Tiny, was a 1928 Olympic champion who went on to a very long career and lived to be over 100 years old. Carole Landis was 29 when she committed suicide. I bought this film because of the multitude of glowing reviews found on this forum. I was not disappointed!
