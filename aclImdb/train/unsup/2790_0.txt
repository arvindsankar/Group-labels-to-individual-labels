I found 7 Zwerge to be a delightful German film and highly recommend it.However, it contains some language based jokes which don't translate well to English, so beware if you don't speak German and watch the film with subtitles to miss a few of the good jokes. But there is still plenty there for those who don't speak the language and overall the plot and humor translates quite well.A great film with a fairly simple plot that is great to watch if you are trying to learn German but also great for anyone who really loves foreign films.Highly recommended to fans of German comedy!
