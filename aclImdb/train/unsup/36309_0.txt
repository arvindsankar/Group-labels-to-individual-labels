Back when I was in college, instead of going to parties or trying to be "popular", my roommate and I watched a lot of movies.Midway through the year, we would run out of movies we had actually heard of, and instead began to rent the most horrible looking films we could find (that is how we found Altered States). And It's how we came across the Horrible Doctor Bones.It's been a few years, but recalling the movie and the plot (heh, heh), I remember some white-boy rapping, an absolutely terrible story, and the longest torso on Dr. Bones that you will ever see on a human. Normally, I am not the best judge of acting talent. For example, I really can't tell the difference in acting between Tom Hanks and Colin Hanks, besides one is quite a bit sexier.If you are looking for some unintentional comedy, you have found the right movie.1/10
