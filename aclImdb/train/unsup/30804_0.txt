A lovely movie. Forget comments about the (apparently) "overt" love/sex scenes. If this was a movie featuring straight/heterosexual love scenes, such comments would not be made.An interesting symmetry with the original . . . Anne Heche appeared (as actress) in the third story of "If These Walls Could Talk", and here directs and writes the third story of "ITWCT 2".Michelle Williams (so very different than in "Dawson's Creek"!), Chloe Sevigny (always excellent), Sharon Stone, Ellen Degeneres, and (most importantly) Vanessa Redgrave give excellent performances.A lovely, lyrical examination of lesbian love - and indeed love and life in general - throughout three very different decades.Highly recommended.You'll laugh . . . you'll cry . . . you'll love this movie.
