I have screened this movie for the 4th time.Watching Demi Moore makes it hard to remember she is not acting (re. suspension of disbelief). Jeff Daniels' character plays a good neurotic.On the pro side, I found the direction fair to midland and the supporting cast excellent.The screenplay is sweetly romantic and sentimental.I did not find the theme overtly pro-homosexual. Rather, it was a mature look of life and love and it's happenstance. I would enjoy talking with my youngsters about the film as it embodies life's essentials.
