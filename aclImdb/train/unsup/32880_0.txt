In what may be one of the truly bad films of all time, the lead actresscries out "Oh My God," whenever anything unexpected happens. I countedsix such outbursts and stopped, but it occurred to me that her words sumup this witless, pretentious,badly acted, badly directed, badly written,badly photographed mess. OH MY GOD, indeed honey, OH MY GOD indeed!
