I didn't get this movie... There's too much usual stories and plots in this movie which make it standard movie.Apart from that, the message is clear and plain, but then, the rumors about the director's sexual orientation which was connected to this movie somehow bothered me.It's about dealing with anomality; sometimes you reject it, sometimes you proud about it, most of the times you're trying to hide it. And it's everybody's dreaming to end your anomality in a grande-explosion which amaze many people (mostly ones who hates you or your anomality).But I can't get more than that.
