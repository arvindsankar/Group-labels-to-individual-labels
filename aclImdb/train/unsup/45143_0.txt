Watching an almost exact replica of a brilliant film executed in less than impressive manner is just frustrating... and an insult to the original.Tortilla soup has the right idea, mainly because it was done once before and more successfully for that matter.I realize it's a remake aimed at a more mainstream audience, but it seems like a bland dish compared to the far more satisfying eat drink man woman.I would recommend the original any day. as for tortilla soup, watch it only if you're curious about the interpretation.If there is one thing Tortilla Soup does well, is that it shows the universal themes of eat, drink, man woman, adapatable to any culture.
