Me goodness!! That was by far the crappiest piece of junk I have ever tortured my senses with. Here's the plot: ----------Here's the story: ---------A careless "the-devil-may-care" french street bum keeps running around aimlessly through mostly train stations or airports, constantly being asked for his passport... then running again... and so on...There's the occasional blurred flurry of faces bothering the viewer's every nerve fiber... and again, the running...Just multiply the above for an hour or so and voil√†! French crap (suzette) at its best!PS: If a certain sheep-look-a-like (goes by the name of Catinca) tries to convince you to watch this flick, just slowly walk away...
