After reading a review on this film and seeing it for only Â£2, I thought "How could I go wrong???"I was (unfortunatly) mistaken....Didn't anybody else (apart from myself) think this film was just PATHETIC ?? How any body can call this a "horror, comedy or fantasy" is beyond me. The ONLY excuse this film has is that it was low budget and was made in 1987.The are SO many 'goofs' in this film you wonder how they didn't notice them.Personal opinion.......AVOID AT ALL COST !!
