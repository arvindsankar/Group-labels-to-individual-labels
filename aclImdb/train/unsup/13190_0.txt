This movie is OUTSTANDING in every sense of the word! It is a must-see & for me, will be a must-buy.It is a movie for ALL AGES.RUN....FLY...get there as fast as you can to see, rent, or buy this movie! Every actor is wonderful & Dakota Fanning has once again "stolen the show".It's also great seeing Kurt Russell & Kris Kristofferson back in the movies.Elisabeth Shue is darling as always! This movie made me want to go out & get a horse & I don't care for horses.Thanks DreamWorks Pictures for giving us a Fantastic PG movie.This movie proves that entertainment doesn't have to have profanity, nudity, or violence to be a HIT!
