First of all I do not know how I landed up to watch this unbearable movie...The characters are really weak, The plot nothing great. And certain moment seem to have been stolen from other movies like Chocalat!!!The script and direction are weak and did not hold me for more then 15 minutes.However I still watched the film till end.How do such filmmakers get financed? I guess there are brave people like me around who make up the audience -maybe thats how.please avoid. Save your money and spare your being...
