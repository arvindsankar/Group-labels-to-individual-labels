I fully agree with lukasbrunner's review below.Such a great story, such a mountain.really deserved something better.As for historical accuracy? Rainer and Angerer were neither "bad Nazis", nor hostile to Hinterstoisser and Kurz: Actually they had decided to join forces before they started the climb.The Nazis never pushed those guys into attempting the North face, nor supported them: If they had government support ,they wouldn't have to stay in tents, and travel to Switzerlandby bicycle! Actually,Hinterstoisser and Kurz's commanding officer tried to stop them, but they chose to pretend they had never received the cable forbidding them to climb. If you want to see what really happened, and who these people really were, watch Joe Simpson's "Touching the Void"
