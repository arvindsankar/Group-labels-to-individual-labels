I see no one has reviewed this flick here since 2007. I saw it tonight for the first time, but just wasn't very impressed. We're the Brits really that blas√© when confronted with terror bombings, destroying their homes? It appears everyone just took it all in stride. This flick has no plot what so ever, just a series of scenes that apparently are recollections of the boy, principle character.I guess, this tells us, if indeed these are his memories, all the real terror and sorrow must have been over the decades entirely suppressed.Although joining a gang and seeing his sister behave as a slut, must have made impressions, we just can't quite ring out what the boy is really thinking.Over all a well filmed series of nicely acted pieces, but hardly a winner of an Academy.
