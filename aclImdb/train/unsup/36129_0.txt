absurdly overrated vehicle for Marin county anorexics, of interestonly to older men charmed by, but largely excluded from, thepretentions of the privileged young. also, of course, to historians ofthe lesser directors of the old new wave.the mannered failure of the principal actress to - well - act isinsupportable, and the annoyance is not decreased by a sensethat the director doesnt particularly care, in fact might prefer it thatway. the looseness of his direction is only pointed by theconspicuousness of passages in which actual actors rebel, andintroduce verve.in short, a film for the voyeur.
