Yes. A 1.And as other commentators have noted, it feels like you are watching a medievalized version of Star Trek. Everyone is giving Patrick Stewart like performances, talking about democracy and human rights---What is this, a 16 year old girl's vision of the Middle Ages? I don't feel fear, I don't feel fear, I don't feel fear, this is the damn mantra repeated by Gere throughout the entire movie . . .So-- Apparently Dare-Devil was a medieval American knight, who had memorized every line spoken by Commander Ryker---The only thing good about this movie---it is hilariously bad.To imagine a middle ages like this, no dirt, no toughness, no rape---Just a Fabio-like fool running about, putting himself through a gauntlet of swinging blades to kiss the hand of the Queen--- Not to be taken seriously you say? Well, if I am not to take it seriously,I am sorry.There are two hours here of silliness to laugh at and foppish villains who talk like Italian designers--But I would say see this movie, if you want to laugh--- Because it is certainly funny.
