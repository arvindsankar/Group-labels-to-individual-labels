Not a bad action/thriller.A bit slow for a action movie, and not quite thrilling enough for a thriller. Still the action sequences were well done and some of the fighting sequences verged on excellent.The story was slightly far fetched and tho the writers tried for twists it was really very straight forward.Jean Reno was good as always and I thought Jocelyn Quivrin was excellent.This movie was like a cross between "the borne identity", "seven" and 100 average cop movies.Worth a watch id you like Jean Reno.
