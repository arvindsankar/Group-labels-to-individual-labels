...I would not have rented this film.The footage and locale are pretty, the actors prettier...but thedialogue is ugly, and the rock and the roll ("highway" rhymed with"my way"), ack.Well the song under the opening titles is catchy, and there's ascene where Daniel Lanois is leading a jam session in apenthouse suite that was sonically interesting.Wait, why am I talking so much about the music. The film is reallynot worth watching. It tries for frankness, but the connectionbetween the characters just never catches spark.Maybe if they had both graduated from Johns Hopkins instead ofHarvard? Or better yet they were both working to become dentalhygienists and Frances McDormand's character worked withbands that never really quite made it rather than Bowie, Iggy,Springsteen...and the record release party was at a dive ratherthan that penthouse suite...But then how would the line "send up another bottle of DomPerignon" play. Ack.Yes McDormand is gifted, but her performance does not save thislatest version of "Young Doctors in Love." Her relationship withChristian Bale as her son, never rises above the lukewarm poolwater titillation.
