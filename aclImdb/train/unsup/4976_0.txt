*SPOILER* for this films entire subtext/overriding theme belowKaren (Saffron Burrows playing it a bit too shrill for my taste, but far from shaming herself) is not the object of Gangster no 55's affections; she was not the person that 55 would rather see dead than be without...It's Freddy Mays.This fact is so barely concealed that its subtext very nearly *IS* the text.To everyone who's reviewed this (by my judgment) excellent film and found that Gangster no. 55 character was run of the mill of any other you'd see in this genre, I challenge you --respectfully-- to give it a second chance, only this time, read between the lines and watch the film take on real life.I promise, the text in between is written in red ink and marked with yellow highlighter. "Gangster no.1" is a story of hideous violence, ambition fueled backstabbing... and unrequited love not at all where at surface glance it appears to be.Rate: 4/5
