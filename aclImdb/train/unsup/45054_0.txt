I would advise not to waste any time or money on this "so-called" horror film.The plot is just ridiculous and goes absolutely nowhere.I realize that the budget for these kinds of low-grade films is tiny, but you could at least try.Nothing in this film is up to expectation..... VERY poor acting, poor direction, silly attempt at special effects, and the story itself is nothing that would hold anyone's interest (even those interested in role playing games!)For placing it in the horror genre, it sure isn't scary at all.Whatever you do, do not waste your time or money on this one!!!!!
