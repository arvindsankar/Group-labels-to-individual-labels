I didn't expect much, or even ask much, from Sci-Fi Channel movies. And I mostly like them. But the only thing that was worse than the script and acting in this stinker was the effects.It was nice to see Kelly McGillis again, although her role was so thinly written it was painful to watch. The no-names show why they will almost certainly remain so.The story, which had potential, was leaden with bland, uninspired dialog, and porno-logic behavior. You simply didn't buy these character, or care what happened to them.Where's Stephen Baldwin when you need him!?!?The scenery was nice, though.
