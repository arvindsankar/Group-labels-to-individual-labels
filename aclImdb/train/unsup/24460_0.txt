Dhamaal is an entertaining movie. However, one can't shake off the fact that the movies LIFTS scenes and story lines from AROUND 5-6 Hollywood MOVIES, right from the first scene.First scene is a rip-off of Johnny English, the third scene is copied from one of Mr.Bean's episodes. The whole damn storyline is EXACTLY IDENTICAL to 'Its a Mad Mad World' and 'Rat Race'. Later one, the movie lifts the bridge scene from 'Road Trip', the tiger roar scene is from a movie called Without A Paddle, and the whole soap gun scene is from 'Small Time Crooks'. On many occasions, it is also inspired by Starsky and Hutch.UPDATE - Just watched 'Dude, Wheres my car?' and the pizza scene is copied directly from there.However, the second half is where we see some originality, and ironically, the most original scenes are the most entertaining. The movie goes for a clich√©d ending, however, which is a downer.THE GOOD - Great performances from the cast, especially Arshad Warsi, Ritesh, and Jaffrey. - Some very entertaining original parts, especially in the second half.THE BAD - You won't have much fun if you have watched the above-mentioned movies. - Some jokes, like the airplane one and the cliffhanging one, are stretched to a point where they are not funny anymore. - Not so great music. - Disappointing ending.Overall, Dhamaal is a decent entertainer, but stumbles badly on originality, as the copied jokes have been done much better in the original movies.
