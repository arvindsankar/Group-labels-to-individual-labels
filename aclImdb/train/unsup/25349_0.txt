This movie is extremely underrated and deserves at least a 5.5/10 Steven Williams and Lou Diamond Phillips are the real stars of this film. The violence was short and the deaths were cheesy, but worthy.This film is about a group of agents who try to bring a witness to testify against a mob boss. But, when they take a shortcut called Route 666, they encounter killers and four zombies.I recommend this to anybody who likes a decent zombie film.MPAA: Rated R for strong violence and language MY MPAA RATING: Rated R for strong horror violence/gore, brief sexuality, and strong language ****out of*****
