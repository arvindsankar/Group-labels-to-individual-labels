Robot Chicken is absolutely hilarious. At first look i thaought it was stupid until my friend turned me on to it and I'm glad he did. i watch it every Sunday at 11:30.I love Stop Motion Animation I think the whole concept is awesome. so naturally i love a show of all stop motion. this is definitely one of my favorites.Don't let the title turn you away. it is only ten minutes long so give it a chance and if you don't like it.... whats ten minutes rightPerfect 10Check it out
