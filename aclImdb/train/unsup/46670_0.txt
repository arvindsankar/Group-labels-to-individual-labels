Wow...what can I type that will make this seem like it is worth reading? Awful and atrocious sets...even for a low budget.Plot that stinks worse than week old diapers.Performanes of wood and not even good wood...rotten wood, full of mildew and mold and worms and stench.Plot...was there one? Oh yeah...I already made a comment about plot.Computer graphics...maybe it's time to start drawing stick figures and happy faces. They look better.Continuity...almost as good as the MUSIC...which is almost as good as garbage, but not so entertaining.Camera work and editing...the bad part is that it sucked...and the good part is that it sucked.Plot...oh yeah...none.The entire movie was just nasty mess of everything that should not ever be made on film.If there is one piece of advice that you will ever take from a stranger...take this. If you are so desperate to watch this...then count backwards from 5 million and do it while chewing bubblegum and skipping rope, because you will enjoy it ten times more and it will make just as much sense.
