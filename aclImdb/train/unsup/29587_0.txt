It's hard to believe that just 4 years after this ridiculous film, Johnson and Taylor costarred in the memorable "The Last Time I Saw Paris." That was a picture.The problem with this film is that the sub-plot would have made the ideal plot. A Chinese doctor is refused admission into his apartment due to racism and bigotry. This would have made for a fascinating problem especially in an era when the movies was searching for relevant social problems of the period.Instead, we are given an inane film where every time Johnson even sips a drink, he goes absolutely bonkers. Come to think of it, this is insulting to people who have drinking problems.Taylor talks in a voice that was appropriate for "National Velvet" but certainly not 6 years later when she was older.Any decent acting here is done by veteran pro Leon Ames, as a city official. His one scene stealer towards the end is memorable.
