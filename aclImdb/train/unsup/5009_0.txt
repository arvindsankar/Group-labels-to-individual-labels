I can NOT understand why this Show was cancelled it was the greatest Show on TV at the time.There had to be a good reason to cancel it.I remember watching this Program when I was in Military Service in West Germany.I did not like it when it was cut off. There has to be some one out there that would know.I've always liked Andy he can play any part they have.Don knots would have been good in this show too. I guess this one was for the Science types.And Back then the science types were the called nerds.Great Show
