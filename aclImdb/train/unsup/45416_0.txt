I hate to see Terry Farrell's talents go to waste. Terry Farrell played Major Agatha Doyle in this movie, but only to put her talents to waste.The movie was so boring that if I didn't have Terry Farrell, it would flop. Same storyline as Agatha Christie's Ten Little Niggers, and honestly, I was bored to death by this book.I give the 4/10 just because of Terry Farrell.
