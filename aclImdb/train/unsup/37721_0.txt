The movie doesn't build up the main characters at all, They are just presented to you. No view into the main characters life at all.Your perspective from the beginning of the film is that the Paul character is your stereotypical movie 'bad guy'. His character lacks substance and meaning throughout the entire film.No insight into why the murders are taking place. No insight into his past, Nothing at all.He is so stereotypical that he snugs his chin into his chest before going in for the kill, A typical horror film clich√©. It used bleak lighting, typical music, and on top of that you have the AWFUL acting. Unfortunately the acting is so bad that it kills any originality that could have been.Maintenance completely lacks originality and substance even though the storyline could very well of worked out with a better cast of characters and better direction.
