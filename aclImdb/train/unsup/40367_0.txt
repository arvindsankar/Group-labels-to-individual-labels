First off, to answer the previous person's question:"Daybreak" was the only song Harry Nillson specifically wrote for this film. Everything else was already lying around.Harry had two top-40 songs with this flick; "Daybreak", and the Pete Ham written "Without You", which had originally been recorded by Badfinger the year before. This film was released on videotape by Apple in 1982 or so. It has never (to my knowledge) been rereleased on either Video, Laserdisc or DVD. Bootleg DVDs of this film circulate among collectors, they are copies of the Video release, and in low-fi mono sound. Besides very brief cameo appearances by Keith Moon, Peter Frampton, John Bonham, and a few other now lesser-known 70's rockers as the band The Count Downes, this film has little to recommend it. Harry's not convincing in the title role, and Ringo is even more plastic here as Merlin the Magician than he was as Larry The Dwarf in Frank Zappa's 200 Motels.For die-hard completists only. NOT recommended.
