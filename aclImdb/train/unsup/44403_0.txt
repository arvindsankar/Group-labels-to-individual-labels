I'll totally exclude the fact that they raped the book. The book is delightful, enchanting and enthralling.The movie is the total opposite of all these things. The acting is awful on all fronts. Terrible directing from Frank Oz, terrible casting, terrible everything. I only revisited this disaster to put myself to sleep last night. There are only a few circumstances for anyone to be seeing this.Dodge at all costs unless you're curious about the book comparison or if you have a kid that you need to distract for 90 minutes or so. Horrendous adaptation, horrendous film-making.
