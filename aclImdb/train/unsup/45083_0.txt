They've got this awesome cast list, you'd think it was an ER convention. It does have a few laughs. But this movie is worse than Battlefield Earth.Spoilers?It doesn't know whether it's a comedy or an action film. THe trailer treats it as a comedy. But the movie is clearly a fake action film. People die faster than a speeding bullit. 90% of the movie is not funny.The premise is interesting, and with a better script writer it may have been something. But alas, we are left with a movie that even Eddie Murphy won't talk about.4/10Quality: 2/10 Entertainment: 6/10 Replayable: 3/10
