Since this film has begun to appear on cheap DVD compilations, I feel it my duty to warn the potential viewer of the following: 1. This film was clearly made as a pilot for a television show which I don't believe ever made it to the home entertainment center.2. This film has nothing to do with the King Arthur of legend.3. This film has nothing to do with any possible historical King Arthur.4. This film has nothing to do with either the Dark Ages, or the Middle Ages.5. The dialog is just one long recital of every "swashbuckler" cliché in film history.6. The actors are very unprofessional and very hammy.7. The story is absurd and absurdly directed. No wonder the actors didn't perform well - given such weak material, who could? 8. The sets were cheaply tossed together, the camera work is shoddy, the editing poor, the costumes a laughable conglomeration of fashions from different time periods, and the action sequences unbelievable and confusingly filmed.Follow the example of TV execs who here made one of their better decisions: reject this film.
