Well, this sort of sneaked up on me.There I was expecting a terrible little b-movie, but what I got was something cooler, odder.I am a great fan of "The Faculty" and my husband, Terry and I have been David Decoteau movies off late, so maybe it was a relief not to have to wipe my brow over another homo erotic escapade.The story is a familiar one, but it is told with some panache. The dead bodies are very coo and the dream sequences are great.Terry and I really enjoyed it and I am excited that there is a sequel. Bring it on!Brian
