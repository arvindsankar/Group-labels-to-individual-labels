I wasn't thrilled by this movie, or even vaguely moved. I wasrestless and listless and found myself looking at the scenery andthe camera movement, a sure sign that it is not working on anylevel. As Emanuel Levy says in his book Cinema of Outsiders, thisfilm has a "senseless narrative and flaunts an arrogant style, butlike The Usual Suspects, it's hollow at the center." I agree. .
