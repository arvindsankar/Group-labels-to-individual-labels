For you complaining about woody acting: this is not a bug, it is a feature. It makes sense the same way it makes sense that the type three is not attacked by the screamers, when you understand what it really is.All these droids and their characters are artificial. Their characters are designed.The machines who designed them have read some Shakespeare, it seems, and watched stereotypical American warrior stories.Get it? It is crappy, but it is meta crappy. Like in Total Recall you are looking at traces of someone else's story within the story.
