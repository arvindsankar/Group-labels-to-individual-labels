I attended the Gala presentation of Arcand's Stardom at the Toronto Film Festival last night and was so disappointed I felt myself getting angrier and angrier for wasting my time through this cliche critique of the supermodel world.It was unoriginal, uninspired and totally uninteresting.I am repeatedly dismayed by my fellow Canadians who champion this sort of crap just because it is Canadian.If you hated other films like Cronenberg's M Butterfly, Egoyan's Exotica, Whale Music, and other Canadian films that were over-hyped, well....you can add this to the list.It is a stinker and deserves the Raspberry.No point in outlining the plot -- it's so predictable and one-dimensional. I'm too embarrassed to introduce you to the characters which never develop, are cliche stock characters portrayed by a series of displays of incredibly bad acting.Ouch.
