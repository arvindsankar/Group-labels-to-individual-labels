I'll never understand, what with the literal thousands of other types of beings/creatures of shadow/darkness, film producers and screenwriters always lean on the old crutch of Christianity when conjuring their creations into being.This movie was a ninety-minute (or there abouts) sermon; nothing more.Sorry guys, but if I wanted to be repeatedly hit over the head by dogmatic Christianity, I would let the fundys in when they knock on my door.If you're into that kind of masochism though, then this is definitely your movie.Almost killed as a child, Nicky's mother promises her daughter's soul to the Devil to keep her from dying, thereby sealing her fate. Or did she? I don't know. This movie can't seem to decide.This is a movie of the Christian heresy of Satanism and is therefore, not my cup of tea, but it seems as if it can not make up its mind. I think perhaps the director suffers from ADHD, or some such malady, as he wants to do a Satanic movie, but then again, Satan does not have the power to do anything...?...I don't know. This is basically just a convoluted mess centered around dogmatic Christian belief and peppered throughout with Catholic doctrines, used here and there whenever convenient, but otherwise ignored.A complete waste of film, if you ask me.It rates a 3.2/10 from...the Fiend :.
