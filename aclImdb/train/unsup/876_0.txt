This film analyzes the creative impulse for advertising & finds it in a asylum...Don't worry: it is not a psychological study but a comedy. The only problem is that I don't laugh often: maybe with the taglines of the ads, the performance of David "Hello" Paymer...How much the leading actor (Dudley Moore), the endless casting of J.T. Walsh as a bad guy, or a bad script (I didn't see much insanity from the patients) have to do with my dozing, it's hard to tell.In conclusion, an average movie where the only flavors are its 80's spirit in America and Hannah in a romantic character.
