From what I remember about what was said in the press about this show, Larson, et. al., had high minded ambitions about this show-He wanted to be fun and interesting for both children *and* adults. Cassiopeia was a "socialator(prostitute?)", remember.However, it was reported that the network was adamant that it be a kiddy show. This lead to increasingly inane plots and cartoon like characters which ultimately resulted in "Galactica '80".I still think the premiere episode and some of the subsequent ones were some of the best work ever done in science fiction.I still sometimes think in terms of "centons", and "microns", and praise the lords of Kobol.I cant wait for the theatrical remake!
