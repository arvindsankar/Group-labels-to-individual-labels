I got this through dvdempire.com. I saw the cover and though this would be your typical slasher low budget flick (the kind I love to watch). What I got instead was a well written and developed character for the first hour or so, and then a cheesy but extremely fun finale that reminded me of the best low budget horror films I grew up with.Not many filmmakers have the cojones now days to just tell a story in detail, without MTV cutting or ADD narrative. That is why I guess some people were turned off by the film.I loved this film!I think Jose Cassella is a triple threat, he scored the film, he shot it very, very well (for DV24p), wrote the thing and directed it. The film looks better than your average $100,000 grade B film ( I am told this thing cost $3500!, try that somebody!).I like to discover little treasures like this, it restores my faith in the new generation of filmmakers.Is it silly and cheesy?...yes, is it insulting for some?...yes, is this for everyone?...nope, but for my money this was a fun ride, a surprising well acted (by the lead), written and made low budget film.I'll be looking for more work by Jose, with a bit more money and a bigger script...who knows? He could throw one right out of the park.Congratulations, you have made a great little film.Luisa.
