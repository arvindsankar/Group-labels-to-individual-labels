The story seems plausible, but the dialogue is below average. Inall, I found this 'romance' unappealing...something bettershould have been done with the idea. What a waste. Thecharacters are not well developed and very little romanceactually makes it to the stars.The funniest part (and this is not saying much) is that Lindarequires her father to deliver all her "Dear John" letters likesinging telegrams. Add one more of those and there may have beensomething to look forward to every thirty minutes.
