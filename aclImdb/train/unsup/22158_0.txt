The movie is not THAT good, but the manipulation of the average vote is ... not good. Add the votes, divide them by voters, that's it. The humor of this is not what I prefer at the age of 38, but back then ... It's 80s trash, it's fun.It's not better than a 5, but voters liked it much more than the " weighted average" tries to make you believe.I'd prefer to ban the "top 1000 voters" than anything else.Description of the movie? No, watch yourself.Recommendation? Not for old people. Not for young people. It's for the eighties' youth only.
