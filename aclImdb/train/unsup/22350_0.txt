I must say that this film was a great surprise, not only because of my personal taste for sci-fi / fantasy flicks, but because this production is flawless.I believe Howard McCain is set to be a true revelation as film maker and screen writer. There is no single bad moment in all the film.Great work in photography and editing make of this film a visual accomplishment.James Caviezel, John Hurt and Ron Perlman performances are excellent.All FX are achieved, and the score by Geoff Zanelli is one to remember.Maybe is something that we all have seen before, but never with this kind of achievement.For all sci-fi / fantasy fans, this one is a MUST!
