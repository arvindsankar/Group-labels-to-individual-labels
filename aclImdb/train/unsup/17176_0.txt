Its the usual modern gangster plot line: people die, drugs are sold, snitches are dealt with. But its the bizarre and hilarious execution of these gangster film clich√©s that make this film a classic.Cam'ron seems to be the next Rudy Ray Moore. This movie is gritty, hilariously weird and endlessly entertaining. Its "Menace to Society" directed by Lloyd Kaufman.The whole thing really comes off like some amazing "backyard film". The dialogue appears improvised. The special effects are hilariously lacking. But everyone gives inspired and interesting performances while just playing themselves. Plenty of one-liners: "Fuck your bread, Bebe!"Great for a drunken movie night with friends who love rap music or weird cinema.
