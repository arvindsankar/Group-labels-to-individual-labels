The plot: A family moves into a house close to a cematary. Something weird is going on in the basement. Could there be a maniac dwelling there?Comment: A horrible movie. Completely devoid of any suspense. Nothing further has to be added.Acting: Horrible, everybody is horrible. The voice dubbing on the young boy is intolerable.Gore: Plenty. Disgusting splatter-filled gore, looks gruesome, not stylish at all.Verdict: 0 out of 4. The pits.
