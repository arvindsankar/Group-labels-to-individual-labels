One of the really bad films of the year. It would be tempting to blame it on writer/director Brad Silberling, but no one in this film acquits him or herself admirably. Susan Sarandon struggles to bring her usual fiery passion to adully-written part, Dustin Hoffman looks great but is otherwise a bore, andJake Gyllenhaal comes across as an annoying Tobey Maguire clone, buteven more annoying than Tobey.The nadir? Possibly this line from Sarandon: "You've given us all a bigtruth enema." Yeah, there's eloquence for you! Gyllenhaal whines his waythrough an unbelievably bad courtroom scene that provokes a desire tosmack him one, and Holly Hunter looks embarrassed as a district attorney. A low mark for all concerned.
