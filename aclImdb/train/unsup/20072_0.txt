It was originally called "Map of the Universe". The book came out in 1994. Then there was the TV show: 'Est' and parts of it are in the film."EST" is just a series of people living in the dark for a period of one month. Like in the film they are all filmed with infra red cameras. They sleep, eat, shower, go to the bathroom all in the dark. The winner is the one who won't crack up and remains in the house for one month. All the contestants live in separate rooms. They can't see. They like 'blind'. It's crazy. The music is frightening.Was "Est" a medical treatment from the sixties?I first heard of the word "Est" in a David Bowie song about his brother, "All the Mad men" from "The Man who sold the World" album.
