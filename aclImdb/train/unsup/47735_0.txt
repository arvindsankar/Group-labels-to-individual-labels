I'll be brief: 1) The movie has a great opening scene (except for the fact that the bed jumped a lot...) 2) Devon Sawa was not excellent, but he did a good job "playing" with his hand.3) Vivica A. Fox is really a fox.. but, so what? She was ridiculous in that movie... I don't understand why a person who made a blockbuster as ID4 (I'm not telling it is a good movie, just is a blockbuster) agrees to join such a horrible movie. 4) To be fair, I laughed in some scenes, but in overall the movie is really awful. 5) If you do not like Offspring, stick with this movie and be satisfied with what the hand does. 2/10. Addam's Family is so much better...
