This must be one of the all time worst films that I have ever had the misfortune of viewing.It appears that the writers did not have their wits about them when they were attempting to develop a plot. They completely destroyed an all time classic -- "Frankenstein." As for the other horror characters in the film, what were they thinking???The special effects were nothing to rave about either. And to add insult to injury, they didn't have a clue about either geography or topography!!!What was amazing is that the female lead didn't even twist her ankle while doing acrobatic stunts in high heels!How far into fantasy do we have to go before we get slapped with a dose of reality?
