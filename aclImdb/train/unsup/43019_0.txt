i have to totally disagree with the people before me.for one,Kristen Storms(?) cant act for her life. i am 13 and i watched Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century when i was like 9 and I still successfully HATED it. really, the plot goes nowhere, the characters are pointless, and the "cool and futuristic" language is really lame. sorry to pop your bubble, folks, but the whole movie is pointless. and not even entertaining pointless, stupid pointless! maybe it could be considered a good movie just so you could laugh at its insane stupidity. the best part of the movie either is the insane costumes or the ending song, zoom zoom zoom. definitely the song-- ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM YOU MAKE MY HEART GO BOOM BOOM MY SUPER NOVAH GIRL! definitely the song.it would get a one, but the song upgrades it to a two.
