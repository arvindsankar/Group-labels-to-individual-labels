Wow, that was absolutely terrible. My neighbor lent it to me to watch and told me it was great, but she's clueless when it comes to horses, obviously. I loved how at the beginning of the movie, the pregnant mare is just standing outside. In the rain; a thunderstorm actually. Like anyone with a mare even remotely close to foaling would leave her outside. How stupid. And then she just died for no apparent reason. It sounds terrible, but I totally cracked up.And then I never really got the point of the sister/boyfriend subplot. It was really dumb and predictable.Next point of stupidity: The girl was riding the two-year-old horse at a dead gallop over terrible-looking terrain at night. By the time that horse is 7 or 8, his knees will be so ruined that he won't be capable of cantering with a rider on his back!And the horse was different in almost every scene. He'd change from flea-bitten gray to dapple gray; he'd change from a Quarter Horse to a Thoroughbred; his face markings would change from a blaze to a snip; it was so obvious! Anyway, that's an hour and a half of my life that I'll never have back. If you haven't seen it yet: don't! I am a horse person; I have 2 horses of my own, so naturally I'm very critical of horse movies. But that was the worst I've seen since Black Beauty.
