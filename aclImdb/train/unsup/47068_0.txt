This movie is no doubt made especially for Amanda, cause it is damn silly and senseless, and worst of all it got really corny and tacky story. Just like her show.Story: A girl left her mom stranded to go to England to meet her father (who doesn't know she exist).There are too many stuff in this movie that is really cheesy, like a boy she just met  she called him Boyfriend, who happen to get every jobs in London, who is also happen to be hired in the Lord's party to sing in the band that can play any song, just ordered!!. Also the soundtrack and the acting suck.And worst of all everything fell into place in the end which is really make it soooo irritating (because everything fell too perfectly).But not everything about this movie is that bad. It got pretty good location, wardrobe has done a pretty good job, they managed to fool Colin Firth to be in this movie, and all the camera did work pretty well.Recommendation: Yes, if you like The Amanda Show  Don't Watch It, for who don't.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: D)
