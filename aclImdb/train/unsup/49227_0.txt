This was truly one of the very worst movies I ever saw. Though it started on a promising note, after five minutes I found myself guzzling an extra-large coke, just so I would have the excuse of going to the rest room to get away from it.My wife and I wanted a light-hearted evening away from the kids, and this movie looked promising. But light hearted it was not. We have a very peaceful life in our home, and I was unprepared for the amount of yelling that was dressed up as dialog. There wasn't anything funny about it. Probably 70% of the dialog consisted of people yelling at each other.We were probably taken in by the trailers, which made the movie appear a bit humorous. The only problem is that all the funny parts were in the trailer. Nothing else was a bit humorous.The only good parts were the first and last songs. The last one, "I Can See Clearly Now" made me see clearly why I should never go to an Aniston or Vaughn movie again.
