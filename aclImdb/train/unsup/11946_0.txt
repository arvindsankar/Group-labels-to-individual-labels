it was a pity that IMDb didn't have the ability to rate movies as 0 because that is exactly what i would have given it. however, i have had to give it 1 out of 10, but i mean 0......plot was very poor, movie was too confusing and the poor plot didn't make me feel a connection, like or dislike anyone in the movie.seemed like random things happening with no explanation or leading up to any event in particular.acting was a bit wooden, and the accent from Dominic Keating was probably the most entertaining of any of the script.please avoid this movie, as you can never get the 90 minutes of your life back that you waste on this.
