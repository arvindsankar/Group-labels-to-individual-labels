Another great Donald Sutherland film and a great caper film to boot.Sutherland stars with Sean Connery and Leslie-Anne Down in a bawdy and fun caper to rob a train while moving of a gold shipment of Â£25,000 heading to pay British soldiers in the Crimean War.A seemingly impossible task that is complicated at the last minute and has some funny twists and turns is a joy to watch. Of course, the real joy is watching Connery and Sutherland as the plan and execute this caper.Great cinematography and Michael Crichton does not disappoint as director of a film based on his own novel.
