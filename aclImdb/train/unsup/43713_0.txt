A misfit/underdog joins the med school.Believes in healing by humour, making personal relation with patients, which is atypical of the docs.Hated by professors and fellows. Professors try to remove him from college.His roomie, who is the topper (also hates him), helps him stay.Now tell me how Munnabhai M.B.B.S is not a copy of Patch Adams! Merely by changing a bit of preamble and postscript of a story, one cannot call it original. At least Robin Williams could bring in some amount of tolerance to Patch Adams, but alas in here, there is none.
