I had never expected the ending! Though I was just getting the 'hints' somewhere in between.The acting by most of the guys is simply great. The movie is quite entertaining. I just felt that the movie would go on.Though Nasiruddin has not acted, his wife & son have filled the gap! I had never imagined that Suhasini Muley could play such a role.Irrfan looks cool and portrays the slightly difficult role (for him it might have been a cakewalk!) effortlessly.Paresh Rawal doesn't need much of writing because he delivers much more than what is expected of him.The most beautiful aspect of the movie is that all the newcomers act very credibly. And they have added freshness to the movie.Shergill is the likable best. On the whole, quite satisfying!
