Just like last years GAB, this sucked. WWE's offer of three excellent PPV's in a row (Judgment Day, One Night Stand and Vengeance) made this writer wonder if they had been made to seen sense, but how wrong I was.Animal and Heidenreich (possible the worst team ever and an insult to Hawk) beat the best team in WWE right now, Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro to win the WWE tag team titles in a rubbish match.Booker T beat Christian in a fair contest, however there was no build up to the match and it seemed that the match was only booked to pad the PPV out.The Mexicools (Super Crazy, Psicosis and Juventud) won the BWO (Stevie Richards, Simon Dean and The Blue Meanie) in a worthless match.Orlando Jordan beat, yes BEAT Chris Benoit in a slump. Why Benoit was wrestling Jordan the worst US champ in history is beyond me.The Undertaker pinned Muhammad Hassan.Melina beat Torrie Wilson in a p*ss poor match, no one cared about the result and it was understandable.Rey Mysterio beat Eddie Guerrero in the match of the night.John 'Bradshaw' Layfield beat Batista via DQ after Big Dave hit JBL with a chair in a lame main event.Overall Grade - D
