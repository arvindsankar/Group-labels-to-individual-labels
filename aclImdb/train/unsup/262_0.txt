This is Rye Seronie with my review of The Bird CageThis movie was great in all aspects except for the overdone, way to stereotypical Nathan Lane. He opened the book of Gay Stereotypes and used every single one of them. Although I have to admit he did do wonderful in his "Teach me" scene as well as when he portrayed val's mother. Val's mother, christine beranski, The senators wife and val's fiance all performed wonderfully. I recommend this movie for a good laugh/pick me up.RatingsPLOT: 9/10 (semi-believable)COSTUMES: No CommentACTING: 9/10 (Nathan Lane overdid it a little)DIRECTION: 10/10 (The movie wasnt jumpy and the plot flowed together nicely)CASTING: 10/10 (They couldnt have picked a better group of people to play in this film)OVERALL: 9.5/10 (Great movie for a good laugh, I bought it and use it as a good pick me up)This has been a review from the sweet and wonderfully crabby Rye Seronie.
