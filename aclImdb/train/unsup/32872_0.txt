Ugh. Awful. Didn't last much past point one. Violent withoutremorse; predictable without restraint; terrible beyond belief.Even my own first self-rejected and childish screenplay was better than this!Women should be picketing this piece of trash. It's abusive and condescending. The writer and director should be ashamed they spent the money this type trash.
