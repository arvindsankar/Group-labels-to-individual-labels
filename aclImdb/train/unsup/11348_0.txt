I am grading on a curve, but this movie was surprisingly good and faithful to the D&D theme. The actors are all unknowns and acquit themselves well, especially Clemency Burton-Hill.This movie is superior in almost every way to the original--the acting is better (none of the overacting of Malcolm McDowell) and the dialogue is decent (cheesy, but not to a ridiculous degree like the original).The best part is how faithful the movie is to D&D concepts like limited spell casting and a Lich controlling Wraiths. And for a $15 million dollar movie (according to IMDb), the producers did a great job of building lavish sets and costumes which give the appropriate mood and texture to the movie (again, in contrast to the fake and cheap sets of the original).The weakest part of the movie were some of the computer effects. Understandable given the budget, but a bit of a distraction, especially since the climax uses a lot of it.Giving this an 8 out of 10 since I'm grading on a scale (this movie was much superior to most direct-to-video or SciFi "original" movies).
