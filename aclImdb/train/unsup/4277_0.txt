If you understand it you'll love it!Not a film for those wanting to be spoon fed.At first look it's "Egads not that kind of stuff again!" But it's much more than Mememto, Butterfly Effect, Dead End, Sixth Sense or other great movie of (similar?) "paranormal" genre.This is truly original and is probably closer to only one of the above mentioned movies. But to say which one would spoil it. I really didn't want to write a review and certainly it's hard to get in ten lines, but the low reviews given previously may have been from those who did-not understand the movie.You "gotta" have brains to enjoy this movie!
