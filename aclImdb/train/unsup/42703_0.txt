This is the most overrated B movie in history. It's "interpretation" to some of the most beautiful music ever made is revolting. "Cute" centaurs and Pegasuses for the Pastoral? Stravinsky for a children's history of evolution? "Abstract art" for Bach's Toccata? Tchaikovsky for dancing mushrooms? If you like classical music (I do) run away from this pretentious garbage.The movie is so bad that it only gets interesting when the music is as bad as it: Ponchieli, Dukas, Mussorgsky, etc. The joke works because the "homage" stresses the banality of the composition.Not recommended for children (too boring, go watch Pixar's stuff) neither for intelligent adults.
