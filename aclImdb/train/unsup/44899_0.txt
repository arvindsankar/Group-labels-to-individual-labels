No kind words come to mind looking back on whatever it was I just fast-forwarded. And I just can't believe anyone would write kindly about it which was the reason I gave this flick a shot. Silly me ey?And just to counter the obvious statements in the "worth a watch" section; it being low budget doesn't give it merit by default. Sewage is sewage and a 100$ turd reeks just as much as one in the lower pricerange.But...something that is worth a watch is also worth a telling, right? so allow me to just sum up this movie for u then: (spoiler, but please be spoiled)-Guy goes to a mountain shed in the snow to undergo an experiment with a doctor, guy gets killed, guy gets revived but now his eyes look exactly like those of master Poo in Kung Fu, guy gets killed another 9 times, gets revived 9 more times and then he walks back down the mountain. Oh..and the dead guy in the snow turned out to be the real doctor.-Honestly folks:..thazzall...Now if this brilliance of a story would have had some cunning dialog or sublime wit in it, it might have been passable. But to top the cake; it had none of it. U will find the dialog between two amoeba more entertaining.Anyone rating this more than a 3 or even having the nerve to find this worth watching, has either been paid to say so or has been paid to say so.This's not even a stinker! 0/10
