"Le boulet" is the perfect definition for the word "disaster" : it happens when untalented French movie-makers try to do a parody of a bad Bud Spencer-Terence Hill buddy movie. "Le boulet" is the proof that the French cultural exception is really about to die. The presence of Benoit Poelvoorde is this unbelievable cinematographic shipwreck is the only positive element :Scenario :	0/10Direction : 1/10FX : 3/10Actors (except Lanvin and Poelvoorde ): 1/10Images : 2/10G. Lanvin : 4/10B. Poelvoorde : 6/10Total : 2.4/10 (I still have the feeling that I over-rated this trainwreck)
