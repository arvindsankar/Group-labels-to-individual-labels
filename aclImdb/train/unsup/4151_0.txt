i was a little uncertain when i was first introduced to this film...my friend had bought it and it really didn't seem interesting, i mean come on...another nazi v. jew film but i was surprised...this story is origional following a little boy who is left alone and is being hunted by the nazi's. his courage comes from a book and his best friend is a little mouse named snow...the story follows the boy as he decides to wait in dangerous territory for his father, whom although was taken away, promised to return...this is a touching story and a great chapter for anyone iterested in this tragic time period...
