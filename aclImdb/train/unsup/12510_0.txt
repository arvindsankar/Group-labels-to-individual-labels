This film is extremely offensive to just about everybody, but therein lies it's beauty. If you are easily offended especially by the C word you will hate this film.If however you are a teenager or twenty something looking for some hilarity then call round your mates, get them to bring round pizza and beer and you have the recipe for an unforgettable evening.Cook and Moore are absolutely fantastic really work well sparking off each other. This would never be released these days - you are unlikely to find anything like this ever again.
