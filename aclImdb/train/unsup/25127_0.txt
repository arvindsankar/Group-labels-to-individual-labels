Grand Hotel is a movie about how people's lives intertwined in there brief stay in a HOTEL- in this case THE GRAND HOTEL.Well in the beginning of the movie the Doctor guy says- "Grand Hotel! People come and goÂ…" Well that is just the way the movie is. The entire movie is filmed inside the HOTEL. The story Not for once goes outside the hotel.And well what happens outside the hotel is all left for our imaginations.The STORY of the movie was superb. I loved it. It was SAD, True, Funny and Involving.Well there are all kinds of characters. The Character's Story Before they came into the GRAND Hotel is never explained. Which is another Superb thing about this EXCELLENT FILM.The Story involving so many people and the way there lives intertwined is REALLY WELL EXECUTED. And well there have been many movies after the year 2000 that have stories involving many people- with their own stories.Well I must say the performances are all GREAT. Especially by JOAN CRAWFORD and Lionel Barrymore. The characters they portray just stole my heart. Too sad that in 1932 there wasn't any SUPPORTING ACTOR or ACTRESS AWARD. If there was than I bet Lionel and Crawford would have won EASILY.All in all, this is a PHENOMENAL Oscar winning movie. And it is also one of the MOST important movies in the History of CINEMA.10/10 I loved it and Enjoyed it!
