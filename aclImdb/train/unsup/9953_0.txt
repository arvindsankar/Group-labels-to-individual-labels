If you have the chance, catch this splendid Ivanhoe remake on the tube or on VHS (it is a crying shame that this doesn't come on DVD, Amazon). It punches several well deserved holes in the tedious, pompous and dire 1952 version with the two Taylors, each performing worse than the other. Come on, Robert Taylor as Ivanhoe?? The 1952 film is clearly a case of a movie being made at the wrong time in Hollywood history.Anyone questioning the acting capabilities of Anthony Andrews clearly hasn't seen Brideshead Revisited. He is a great, believable, and may I add, gorgeous Ivanhoe.The film boasts a great, thought provoking script (which granted does take some liberties with the source material although much of the lovely dialog from Scott's book has found its way into the film), great performances (especialy by Neill, Mason and Hussey and the incomparable George Innes as Wamba) as well as beautiful production values and photography.And, as an added bonus, it is a virtual babe fest (Wilson, Neill and Andrews are all at their physical prime here)!
