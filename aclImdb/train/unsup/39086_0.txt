I preferred the original, it was much more gripping. There's not a lotof great acting here, with the exceptions of Harvey Keitel and BrianDennehy. Everyone else seems to be posing up a storm, like they cast abunch of models, led by Gorgeous George Clooney, still tilting his headand smirking as though that made a character come to life. I wasdisappointed by this and angry that they remade a great movie into aho-hum one. Skip it.
