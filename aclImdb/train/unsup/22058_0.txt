This film is a sleeper. I had never heard of it an hour and ten minutes ago, and just caught it on television. William Powell's performance is outstanding. My own delightful surprise find was Aline MacMahon, who was sublime as the Countess; what a beauty she was. The sound and visual effects as shown on TCM are crisp and clear. It's a solid film that belongs on DVD.I suspect we will never get the chance to own it for home viewing because of its age-1932, and the unfortunate trend of too many to dislike or ignore films older than six months
