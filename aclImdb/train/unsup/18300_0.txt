A gorgeously photographed and steamy tale of forbidden passion.Boasting a superb lead performance by Patrick DeWaere as a young Frenchman battling to stifle the seductive advances of his breathtakingly beautiful step-daughter, it is grounded by fascinating character detail and an intelligent, focused script that is deeply interested in the complexities of love and desire.Ariel Besse is the step-daughter and she is a bubbling, nubile cauldron of curiosity and mischief.Sacha Vierny's moody photography is worthy of a coffee table hardcover and Philip Sarde's score is perfection.A delicious, provocative, mature tale of sexual politics.
