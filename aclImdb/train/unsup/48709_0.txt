"Greeks on the Roof" is another example of the brain dead, banal, lame and dull witted Australian comedy which apparently can't seem to get by without referring first to some bodily function.Add the parade of equally retarded Australian non-entities they brought on as guests and the whole show degenerated into an appalling parody compared to "The Kumars at 42". The "Kumars" is innovative, classy, witty, intelligent and wholly entertaining. Words that Australian comedy (or lack of it to be precise) just can't comprehend."Greeks" should have been banned for the sheer atavistic cruel torture they inflict on one's intelligence. To describe the show as stupid would seriously be a compliment. This is no exaggeration The same ban should apply to the soap "Neighbours" which could accurately be described as a trip down insanity lane. Talk about suburban boredom!!!Put the 2 shows together and suicide would be a blessing.
