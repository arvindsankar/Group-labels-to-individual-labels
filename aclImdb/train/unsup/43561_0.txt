I was kind of looking forward to this, and I'm sad to say that it's not very funny.Ben Stiller is once again Ben Stiller, and Owen Wilson has his usual red-eyed-I may have been smoking before they yelled action- delivery that can make some dumb lines kind of funny, but other than that there's not much there there.Snoop Doggy is actually the scene stealer here. Vince Vaugn seems miscast.I liked the car a lot, but as I was waiting for it to end I kept thinking that this is what they mean by the January/February movie doldrums.I'd give it four stars.
