Was forced to watch this by a "friend" and can honestly say this is one of the most tedious boring films that I have ever seen.From the little of the film that remains with me it's about some old git in a study with some annoying woman having something to do with the plot as well of course the mummy itself.For most of the films too long running time most of the main characters are talking in the study with an unconscious old man.For some reason the film includes sex scenes that seem to come out of nowhere and have nothing to do with the story although they rarely do.Avoid this there is nothing redeeming in this film at all - it's boring.
