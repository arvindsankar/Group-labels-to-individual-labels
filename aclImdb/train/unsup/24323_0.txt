You get Anol. Which pretty much says it all. (Thanks to TA for pointing this out to me).Yes, this movie is stupid. But not in the Troll2 funny kind of stupid. It is an hour and a half of pure boredom punctuated by brief episodes of incredulity. Let's get this straight guys. Lawyers in coffee shops do not save the day. They drink coffee and get stoned when they go home.Girls who work for escort services, are expected to service their clients. They don't get lucky shots with some crap in a sock.The average "madam" is not some sweet lady that cares about her workers. She's a user, just like the Johns.Almost forgot, the dialogue is just horrible.
