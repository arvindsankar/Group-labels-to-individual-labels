Positively one of the worst horror movies ever. Bad script, acting, music... you name it, they've got it.Other bad horror movies are in the least funny. Sitting through this is absolutely painful. Utterly horrendous... The most HORRIBLE HORROR.Loads of cliches and overacting. The cheap ass crap music reeks of teen movies. Romantic lines and scenes just gives me the shivers and I get goosebumps from all that corny junk.I can't stand that idiot cop as well.YUCKS. AVOID THIS MOVIE.
