Hello together,i was very shocked about the film, because i saw in Bangkok the same like in the film. It makes me very sad. I saw the film a few days ago but now i am thinking about pla, most girls have nothing to change - they must work in bar because they are the money-maker for her family.Up-to-date: But now there are different statements about pla. Is she dead or alive!? Some people say, she is alive and now outside of thailand, other say she get killed by people of this business and other one told me she get dead by car-accident.Can someone who really know whats up with her tell me the please. Thank you very much, catpillar-1
