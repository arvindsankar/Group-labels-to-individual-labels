OK this is a low budget movie - but even some low budget movies have good acting. The film "Manticore", for example was low budget but it did stand up because the acting was good. Draculas Curse lacks any descent acting - in many scenes the actors seem unsure of what their next line is which makes me wonder if this film was properly story boarded. The poor screenplay, direction and editing back up my suspicions.The fight scenes were consistent with the general low quality of the film. The story was kind of interesting but is over shadowed by the over all poor quality of the film.Avoid at all costs
