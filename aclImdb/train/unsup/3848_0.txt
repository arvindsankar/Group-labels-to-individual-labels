When celebrating the cycle-of-life "Cabaret" sits on the spice shelf.A town which is occupied by a sausage-factory which comes to life when the meat-plant workers come in for rest and relaxation and perform the lessons and morality-tales which are learned from safe and unsafe handling of food and objects around different life-forms.That sex, love, and family must sometimes be sacrificed to perform and follow the foot-lights of the stage.War is sometimes a bi-product of military-personal racing to their favourite performance venue(s) where "other" children and wives lived and worked in Europe and especially in Germany.The cycle-of-life is the call for many to chase the memory and contact with those people and places which made them excel at something, namely war.That in the end the only way to keep some of the universe's life-forms from racing to a celebration of war as depicted in other films such as "Wood Stock" and "Schindler's List" was to electronically engage and control the minds and movements of those who chase a special moment based on the destruction of others.The difference in the end was the sausage and the workers.Which are you?
