It was terribly boring. The soundtrack was woeful - some shots would have come to life much better with dramatic and more moving scores.The dialogue was predictable.Were they targeting an adult audience or kids? I was lost. It was not entertaining.The only reason I kept watching was that I ate dinner late and I needed to let it digest before going to bed. Otherwise I would have been in bed 60 minutes ago.They must have had a shock after the edit. "Gawd, how are we going to sell this?"
