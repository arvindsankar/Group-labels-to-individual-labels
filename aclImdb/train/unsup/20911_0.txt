This is the best Adam Sandler movie I have ever seen.I am no longer a teenager so I generally avoid Sandler's movies like the plague. Beside a couple of Penis-envy jokes this movie is actually a joy to watch in mixed company.Well worth your time.If this is some of Jack Nicholson rubbing of on Sandler I look forward to Sandler's next movie.Nicholson is completely over the top with his role.Rating 8/10 for a comedy. 10/10 for a Sandler comedy.
