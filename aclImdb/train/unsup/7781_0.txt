I saw this film in LA, and I have to say that I was practically transported to Cedar Sinai after the screening because I was laughing so hard...The cast was so funny and brilliant, that I wasn't sure who the real "pros" were and who were staged actors. SO needless to say my porn collection has grown now to, but not many of the actors in the film are easy to find...The two leads were excellent, these guys should have their own show on Comedy Central HBO or Oxygen!I have bought the DVD, and finally realized the true comic stylings of these guys once I saw the outtakes, special features, etc...This is the perfect Hanukkah gift for any comedy lover or porn aficionado...
