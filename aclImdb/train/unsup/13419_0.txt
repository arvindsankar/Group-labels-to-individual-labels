An atrociously made, acted and dubbed cannibal movie that is also very tame in terms of violence (except for a scene where a crocodile is skinned alive) and nudity (it must have been on the female lead's contract not to have a single nude scene). The "highlights" of the film's stupidity include:A: The poorly integrated stock footage of animals killing each other.B: The lamest attempted-rape sequence you'll ever see.C: A scene of the cannibals having circled around the hero and then attacking him one-at-a-time, and him defending himself with karate moves!D: A silly conversation about whether the cannibals have any chances of "adapting to our civilization" ("Well, it's gonna take quite some time"!).E: The already-mentioned axe-boomerang scene, and a terribly edited spear-throwing scene a few seconds earlier.The on-location filming is the only thing that forces me to give this film one star, instead of none. Only for the desperately curious.
