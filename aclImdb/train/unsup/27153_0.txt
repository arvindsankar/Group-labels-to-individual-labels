The comment from the person who saw this as an 8 year old certainly brought back memories for me.I must have seen this film at least three times during the pre-TV days of Saturday morning special programs for children.If you've ever sat in a theater packed with eight to twelve year olds all bawling their eyes out together, you know it is something you'll never forget. I was able to find a VHS of the movie in later years and was astonished to find how charming the picture is on the adult level as well. Kudos, hugs, and kisses to anyone still alive who helped put it together.
