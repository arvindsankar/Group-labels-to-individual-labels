This film seemed to be going for shock value, but without much sense of reality in the script or in the acting. No addict of any kind would submit to the indignities depicted here unless predisposed to do so. I rated this 2 out of 10, though, because of a pretty cool soundtrack, and because "Dorothy" was kinda cute. ;-)
