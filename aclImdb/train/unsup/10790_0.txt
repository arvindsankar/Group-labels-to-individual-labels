a complex, non-narrative 20+ min. experimental film, "pandora's paradox" has a really interesting set of scenes, like a woman giving birth to a giant, bloody toe, an unforgettable sex scene, and its impossible climax, which makes this film really stand out. very inventive camera shots and effects are used, and it's one of the very few "art films" that make you want to watch it over and over!some may say that "pandora's paradox" is weird and inexplicable, but if you have an open mind, you'll quickly understand the general feeling of the film: betrayal, an urge fornormalcy, and revenge. this director can go places!
