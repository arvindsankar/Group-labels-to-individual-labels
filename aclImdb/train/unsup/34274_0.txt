I came to this movie with some expectation, and having read some favorable reviews on IMDb: that was a big mistake.Just because there are some well known "names" in the cast do not believe that will save this film, because it does not.Briefly: a retired cop gets entangled in some blackmail/murder plot, but the whole picture is boring, self indulgent and unbelievable.The script is poor, and none of the players give convincing performances. The story, the plot and the players are all unrealistic in the extreme and just because they have made their career by other films will not salvage them or this picture.1/10.
