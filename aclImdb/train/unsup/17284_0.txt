Buying The Cow is a tale of David Collins (Jerry O'Connell) who freaks after his girlfriend begins hinting for a proposal which results in him dating strange women. Ryan Reynolds and Alyssa Milano play a gay man and a hot girl. Buying the Cow had some comedy flow but it was not what I expected before purchasing. It is more serious then I realised for an O'Connell film. It had something that grabbed me but didn't quiete real me in. See for yourself.Pros well acted, realisticCons didn't quite grab me, predictable
