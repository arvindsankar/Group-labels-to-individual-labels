There you have at least two great actors who really give what they can but there's no director.These two actors, Goldblum and Dafoe, are all alone in this insane brain sh... Nobody can explain them their purpose and so the audience is lost in this strange story which probably wants to make sense but there is no one who can press any sense and logic out of it.It probably could have been a movie that is strange and disturbing and which make you think about humor and hope but sadly it's a movie which is strange, embarrassing and stupid.There should have been a director, who is just as crazy as the story itself. I think Paul Schrader is a too boring person.
