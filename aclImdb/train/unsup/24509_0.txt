Oldest reason in the world: money.Watching it you would think that there are no Austrian, German or Swiss valuable books that could be filmed or any new ideas or the courage to follow them.Instead the filmmakers decided to make an Austrian version of a very well known and at least as well discardable American soft horror trash.In the past it used to be the other was around; Hollywood, due to the relative short history of the USA, used to look to Europe to find inspiration in its rich traditions and plurality of cultural streams.If in Europe too money will become the only reason to make movies, we can expect not much else in the future.
