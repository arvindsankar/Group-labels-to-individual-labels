Ten years ago I loved this type of movies; Action, SciFi, Van Damme. It should have everything an 18 year old would love in a movie.But even back then this particular movie stroke me as not being a very good one.Yesterday I watched Cyborg again, and oh my god...... this is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen quite a few.
