This movie is horrible, the dutch film industry should be ashamed for producing crap like this.The acting is horrible, the story is horrible, the jokes are horrible and not even close to funny, every ingredient in this movie is horrible and it's only getting worser throughout the movie.I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the IMDb rating! If there was a number below 1.0 I would have voted that, because even a 1.0 rating is very overrated for this 'movie'.Watching this movie is throwing two hours of your life in the trashcan, so don't go see it or be very disappointed.
