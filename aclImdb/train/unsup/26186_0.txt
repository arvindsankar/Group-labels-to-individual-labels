A definite film of the macabre again proving that there was no one like Geraldine Page for these neurotic, vicious parts.In this one, Ruth Gordon takes a job as a maid in Page's home under false pretenses. It seems that Gordon had a disagreement with her long time domestic, played by Mildred Dunnock. In a huff, Dunnock walked out and went to work for Page.Seems that Page has quite a history. Once she finds out that her maids have no family, she does them in quite neatly.Throughout the film you constantly are hearing Page yelling Mrs. Dimmock to maid Gordon, as she begins to suspect that Gordon is no usual maid.The film takes place in the desert of Arizona which seems to place a peculiar and effective aura to the film.The ending is an absolute knockout.
