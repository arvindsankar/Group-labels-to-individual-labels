This is a very loosely biographical based movie on Vlad Dracula, and it was a very refreshing change.Roger Daltrey is the weakest actor, and he is pretty good.Rudolf Martin was perfect for the role of Dracula, what a mix of passion, and vanity.The story is fact based and if you know your history you can see it weaved though-out this tale. The sets are amazing for a fairly low budget movie.The fight scenes are fair to slightly above average, but this movie is so strongly written you can forgive the weaker fight scenes.One of the Best Dracula movies I have seen, and by far the best low budget historical(ish) Vlad movie I have seen.
