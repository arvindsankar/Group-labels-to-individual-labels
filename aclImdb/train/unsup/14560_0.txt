It is clear that most viewers will be extremely disturbed by the pace of the film... Describing two plots (one in antiquity, one now) and using the same actors, and a series of flashbacks to get his point across, Claude Lelouch uses his traditional style in a confusing manner which will make the film beyond the understanding of many.3h20 minutes later, the mystery is solved, fully, and it is plain that he was in control all the time... not like other directors who can't make a clean film with a linear time line.From the gorgeous Marie-Sophie L., Beatrice Dalle, Vincent Lindon, the cast, although familiar faces in Lelouch's films, all show their talent. Even late Paul Preboist, usually too strong in his approach, delivers a beautiful performance.Music is in perfect harmony with the images, inclusing Brel, gypsy music, bullfight themes perfectly and flawlessly.If you only heard about Lelouch but never saw any of his films, "Ladies and Gentlemen" would be a better first film than this one as this one is possibly very confusing... but a masterpiece nonetheless.
