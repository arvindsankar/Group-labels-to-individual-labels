Many classic scenes, Bombs Away, TV in the aquarium, Barbra's hands and heart placed just .....hovever, when the DVD company from hell released it on DVD, they censored a word that renders an entire scene meaningless.It was an historic word also, the first time a star had eversaid it in a major film. F***!! The only time anyone hasever censored Barbra to this day! Still a great comedy!Sexy, funny and way ahead of its time! One of Bab's best! George's too!
