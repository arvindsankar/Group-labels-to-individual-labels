I really enjoyed this movie. The film starts off a bit slow, but it is so true to real life and real people.I like Jean Reno and Juliette Binoche very much, although they both looked very different physically from their usual selves. I didn't even know it was Juliette till the credits came up.It was nice to see Jean in a non-action film.I highly recommend this movie to any romantics out there!
