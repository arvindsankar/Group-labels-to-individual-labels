*Se7en SPOILERS* Homicide Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on his last week of work, and is partnered with the new kid in town, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), and as this partnership starts, they begin to face a very vicious serial killer who murder according to the Seven Deadly Sins.This story is not going to have any happy ending, and especially not for Mills and his wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow)...Intense, scary, really well-written, with top notch production designers and cinematographers, who create a very unhealthy and dangerous looking metropolis, 'Se7en' is absolutely a movie to buy and put in one's collection, especially if they love well-thought out thrillers.You can see echoes of this still today; as an example, in the movie 'Saw', where the Jigsaw Killer seems to have a moral code not too dissimilar from John Doe (Kevin Spacey)'s one.But be careful, because it's certainly not for the weak of heart.Se7en: 9/10.
