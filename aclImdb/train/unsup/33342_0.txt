This film is dreadful on every level.It masquerades as cleverly thought-through juxtaposition and story. When it's nothing more than a bloke with an idea and a corpse he feels the need to bury.Written by the genius that wrote Amores Perros, translated into vapid nothingness by Hollywood. The squandering of what was doubtless a brilliant script.Watch the sunrise instead, or watch this film and pause a moment to write a review that actually explains why you think it's actually good. Without looking for theme, symbology and story that isn't actually there...
