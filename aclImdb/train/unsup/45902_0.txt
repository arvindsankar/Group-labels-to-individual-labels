This might have been called Lost Girls...or Bratz Dolls: The Movie!If any single phenomenon might symbolize the death of romance & heterosexuality it could be the Suicide Girls. Their name says it all. They seem about as estranged from the organic sense of their bodies as anyone on earth could possibly be. They seem to regard their bodies like drum majorettes regard their bodies or pompom girls their skirts. They are little forlorn islands of desolation & despair. They make Gummo play like Singing in the Rain.The occasional individual insights are pathetically revealing. The one who calls herself Reagan (Reagan? Nixon? Is all this a political statement? - I don't think so...) says that she really appreciates being forced to mingle with the public in the companionship of her "sisters" because otherwise she might have become an antisocial person who watches TV or sits in a corner & reads books. Books!! Egads! What a concept.On & on it runs.Great if your want to get turned off to sex or just get generally DEPRESSED!
