I played a small part in 'Wally Norman" as the bookmaker.Had a blast doing the role and meeting the rest of the cast.As time goes by this comedy gets better.....each time i watch it i see something new.The cast and crew worked so hard on this flick and the movie deserved better at the box office.Seems like the average movie goer here is more interested in the Hollywood blockbuster than the subtle film.This comedy was very well written but not everyones cup of tea.The pub scene when Wally comes back after the goat race was a hoot to shoot with free beer flowing all day.The goat ate the wreath of flowers round it's neck but luckily the cameraman got a shot of it and it was used in the movie.Anyway have a great life everyone.Cheers Paul Makin.ps Singo for PM.
