it only gets a 1 out of ten because you cant select a zero! i have never felt compelled to comment on a film before but was so disappointed in this film that i had to register and say my piece.i first heard of the film years ago, lots of hype about it being a great little indie zombie film (i am a huge huge fan of the genre), then when i eventually got hold of a copy it was well packaged and the cover looked good......after the opening sentence i had already made up my mind that this film was complete and utter tripe but i still gave the movie a chance.i know that the budget was modest but $80.000 is what it cost sam raimi to make the evil dead (though tatty - a real classic) and he rented proper equipment and had some decent actors, and also showed some directorial flair.this movie was just completely classless and does little in homage to the greats such as carpenter, raimi and romero which it so shamelessly rips off from and it is pretty embarrassing for them to be noted as jr bookwalters inspiration for the film as this really isn't saying much.no wonder producer raimi wont put his name to this abomination.some elements of the film could have been good ideas, the original script for romeros day of the dead had an army of trained zombies but due to budgetary constraints had to be cut - a shame because it would have been executed infinitely better than in this film.in summary i was expecting to view a little known jem of a film but was left feeling annoyed that id been duped. if you want zombie classics, re-visit the dead trilogy(now quadrilogy)or evil dead films - don't waste your time and money on this.
