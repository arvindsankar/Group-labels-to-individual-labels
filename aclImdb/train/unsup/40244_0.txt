My gods, I want those 28 minutes of my life back! This so-called movie is a therapist's dream client. The guy who wrote this has issues, massive, major issues.It was worse than any Woody Allen movie I've ever seen.So his dad's a jerk. Well, grow up. You aren't your dad. Get over it.How the hell did this thing win an Oscar? It was pure, utter crap.I saw this tonight at a screening of the five short animated films nominated for the Oscar, and I cannot possibly fathom how any of the other four lost to THIS.Avoid at all costs.The writer of this film should issue a written apology to the world for unleashing this massive Shite Monster on us. I've seen the Shite Monster, in the movie Dogma. This was its poppa.Did the people who voted for it actually SEE the movie? Or were they just impressed by its length?
