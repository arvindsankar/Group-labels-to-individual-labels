Has a big fan of the series I was very disappointed in the movie. It was as if it was completely something else. Not much from what made the series a hit was use in the movie, except the hip.The music, the jokes, the stories where all simplified to accommodate the newbies, so it lost all it's charm and originality.Even if I didn't new the series before seeing the movie, I wouldn't of give more then 4 out of 10 for this piece of ...Everything is very predictable, nothing is really funny or new, nothing to push me to the limits. I wish I've never seen it!
