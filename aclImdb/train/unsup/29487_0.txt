Edith Wharton wrote in a brilliantly minor key, and it is a testamentto Martin Scorsese's genius as a filmmaker that he disciplinedhimself to work within Wharton's parameters, instead of trying toforce his trademark kinetic style onto a story of tragic whispering. Abeautiful, heartfelt film, with a superb performance from DanielDay-Lewis(really, what else could you expect?).
