Wow, I just saw it on DVD, and I couldn't stop laughing.The scene when the father is stuck "in" the reporter... it was so over the top and insane and funny, that I think I just peed my pants.Who would have thought, a movie that talks about: incest, rape, bullying, with insane black humor, that promotes family values...I'm surprised so many people didn't get the humor/meaning of this movie.You have to go beyond the violence/sex to understand it, like any Miike's film.Unique, extremely funny and disturbing.8/10
