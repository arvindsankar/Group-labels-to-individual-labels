This probably is one of the worse films I have seen surely the worse of this decade to date.I mean if you think of the actual story line it only makes sense. Four friends who are all "know it all" meet up in the forrest and they get attacked by aliens. Wow...it sounds like a great movie!!!We don't get to know why this is happenning how the story started and where it is going. Maybe it is because I slept a bit while watching this.i thought highly on the works of Stephen King, but this surely is an excpetion.
