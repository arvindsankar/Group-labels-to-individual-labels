Despite the ridiculous plot, this shows what a very strong pair of actors (Heston and Zerbe) and a very visually arresting director (Boris Sagal), and a strong musical talent (Ron Grainer) can do, to say the least of Richard Matheson who is an acknowledged wizard in the field of paranoid science fiction (a particular genre).The film is gut-wrenching on many levels and is one of my top 20 films. Heston does the loner better than any other actor.Grainer, who scored the remarkable score for McGoohan's Prisoner series, is in fine form, with an excellent score.Sagal's visuals are absolutely gripping.Zerbe is the perfect antagonist and shows that his TV persona works perfectly on the silver screen.If you get the movie, turn the lights down and watch it at night. You're in for a treat.Many good lines in this movie.
