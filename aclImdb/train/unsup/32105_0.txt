A great cast like the one assembled for this film is often a warningsign. How many movies have you gone to see because of the cast,only to see their talents wasted? 'Gun Shy' breaks that curse; it is agreat, imaginative and fun film. At first the storyline may seem disjointed, but wait; the threads are woven together and culminatein a lovely ending which I found refreshingly sweet. Liam Neeson's is one of many great performances--he must haveloved this role as an antidote to the turgid mess that was 'PhantomMenace.' Oliver Platt and Richard Schiff are fine as well.Highly recommended to those who look for a little intelligence andhumanity in their entertainment.
