Vic Morrow, as Coach Turner, gave some of the greatest lines..Morrow to his young little league team in the dugout before the championship game, I don't want to talk to you about winning. I want to talk to you about losing....because if you lose you are going to have to live with it for the rest of your lives.Morrow to his son, the pitcher...Joey, if you don't start pitching better than you are hitting, I'm going to take you right out of the game.Morrow to semi tough kid Jack Earle Haley..This place is for ball players, and nobody wants you around here.Morrow to opposing coach Matthau..What are you, one of those sadists or something? Joyce Van Patten to everybody..They win one game. Next they will sue to play at Dodger stadium.Morrow to his son the pitcher after he strikes his son to the ground, Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me. You tried to hit that kid.Joyce Van Patten tries to kick Haley's motor bike after he throws a lit cigarette at her after she tells him to get off an unused part of the ball field.
