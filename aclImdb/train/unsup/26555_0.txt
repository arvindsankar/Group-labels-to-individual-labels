There is no denying that for its day and age this is wonderful.Given that it is nearly a century old it holds up very well.Though slow in places and long at 2 hours and 19 minutes I can imagine the original audiences must have blow away by the special effects, action, and story, costumes and sets etc;If course, the real selling point is Fairbanks who truly lights up the screen. Yes, its hammy even for a silent movie, but what comes across is his boundless energy, his enthusiasm, and the love of what he does.Recommended for all those who love swashbuckling adventures!A treat to go back in time.
