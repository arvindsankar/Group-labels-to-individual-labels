Sorry, but I don't agree with the people here. The acting was diabolical, it was like porn movie acting, it was terrible.I fell asleep through it, it wasn't gripping, it wasn't impressive, it was a badly acted, thrown together film. and even though I had fallen asleep, it was like I had watched the whole thing, very apt there is torture in this film as it was torture for me to watch it.This was referred to me by a friend, who incidentally had never seen it, but read reviews, possibly on here, where the gushing kissing of asses is so evident.The lead actor is terrible, he cannot act, in fact none of them can act, Suplee does what he does best, plays weirdos and Mewes is doing the same role as usual, it's the sort of film that had been written in a day and then filmed over two days, it is that bad.If you are an artsy fartsy type, then you may like this film, or you may just say you like the film to make yourself appear cultured, but you are only fooling yourself. Don't believe the hype.A film about a violent sexual assault and I fell asleep, well it says it all doesn't it?
