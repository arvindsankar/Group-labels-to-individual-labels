My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****One word I would use to describe Die Hard is energetic. Once this movie gets started it doesnt slow down. The action scenes arent overblown like some in the movies today. The movie is set at a perfect pace. Although the movie is expertly paced, it is well made in other areas. The movie is well written, both storywise and dialogue. It has some very good one-liners. Another area that is worth mentioning in Die Hard is the acting. Bruce Willis may not be the Best Actor, but he is very good as John McClane. Alan Rickman is fantastic as the villain, possibly the best or at least one of the best villains in an action movie. The rest of the cast gives solid performances. Die Hard may just be some action movie, but it is one of the best.My Rating: ***1/2 out of
