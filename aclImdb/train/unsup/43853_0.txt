Harlan County Kentucky is a beautiful place not Vancouver in Canada were the movie was filmed.The people of Harlan County Kentucky do not talk like Granny of the Beverly Hillbillies as Holly Hunter did.Why were the people of Harlan County Kentucky left out of this movie.The coalminers strike in Harlan County Kentucky was alot more than what this movie portrayed.I was embarrassed for the maker of this movie.
