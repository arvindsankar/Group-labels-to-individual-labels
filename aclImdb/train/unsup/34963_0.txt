BIG SPOILERSThere was absolutely nothing I enjoyed about this film.. those who think "Carnage" is the worst ever.. they should watch this...There are 6 people who have done something sinful, who knows what it was-- and these six people get invites to a class reunion at their high school.. It's just them, and then this preacher guy shows up at the school --I have no idea how or why!! And he basically murders the six people who try desperately to elude this loony toon to get out of the school alive!!!The preacher also uses like 4 different disguises, a skeleton, clown, and something else....I really didn't care whether these characters lived or died-- it was that boring...The deaths are basic--- shotgun, revolver, sword in head, little flamethrower another sword killing, and a girl gets drowned in a restroom sink!!!!6 different deaths for each of the six people..!!!As it turns out, they all never escape, and they ll get murdered!! And the psychotic preacher is shown at the end as a very regular "unpsychotic" preacher preaching at a service...then the boy who we see rise from the lake in the beginning, gets back on the bus, and gets driven to the lake.. and he walks back under the water to where he arose from... ends with a quote from the bible!!!Don't watch unless you have insomnia-- this will put you right to sleep!!!This was a double feature DVD with Carnage from EastEnd DVD's.com--Absolutely no extras, no scene selection on either movie--- I already have the VHS movie of Carnage which was better than the Redeemer: son of Satan! So I took the DVD, and ran in electric saw through it!!!!"The Plumber" is as just as bad- except I rented that one-- good thing I did!! Took it back IMMEDIATELY after I watched it!!
