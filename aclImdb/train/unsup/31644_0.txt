Ann Harding and William Powell are terrific in this strange little gem of a movie which runs the gamut from Pre-Code Drama to Screwball Comedy! (the closing dinner party scene is worth the price of admission). John Cromwell directs with a sure hand, especially in a great tracking shot involving the two sisters.It's incredible how modern films seem to lack any sense of sophistication and style in comparison with even lesser known films from the 30's like this one.A pure joy to watch.
