It's a fact that over fifty percent of the films made prior to 1950 will never again be seen due to the deterioration of the film's negative, from nitrates or fire. God, how I wish "Shoot to Kill" was one of those films.I'm not going to go into what this movie was about, because with all of the flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks, you're going to grow tired of watching it, like I did, and not care.The acting is horrendous. Through the whole picture whenever Edmund MacDonald appeared, all I could think of was, "Murder! Murder at Midnight!"(fans of Abbott and Costello will know what I mean). It's sad to think that he was better in "Who Done It" than he was in this thing.Russell Wade showed his usual range of dull to bland. The highlight was when he was in the nightclub with Luana Walters, and the angle of the shot had a table light covering the bottom part of his face.Avoid at all cost.2 out of 10
