This film failed on all counts. While I accept that couples of any age can experience the problems that these couples are dealing with, but throughout the film it seems that their real problem is that they are bored.The ending was the only part of the movie that I thought made any sense, and then only just.My wife and I almost never agree 100% on movies, our tastes are completely different. We both 100% detested this film.So, to summarize: * No Plot * Bad Writing * Actors who seem disinterested in the material, or they were poorly directed * Zero nudityThere are much better movies that cover similar territory, find one.
