I doubt it. But this one is pretty thick-headed, which sort of ruins the movie. I suppose that he's not supposed to be a street cop, but it's still inexcusable. He's on a mission for personal redemption. The only problem is that he's pretty bad at it.It seems that a lot of people find this movie to be disgusting, which suggests that they haven't watched many movies. The gross factor is actually pretty low.Other than that, the plot and production are pretty good. The music is great.Overall, you can spend 90 minutes with a worse movie.
