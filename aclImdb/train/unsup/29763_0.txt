this is a very disgusting movie. i would refrain from watching it unless you are into mother and son sexual perversion relationships, molestation and bondage.i was bitterly disgusted. there are ways to film such scenes showing everything! the closeups of penises are uncalled for. the script is confusing.. the movie is a waste of time, unless of course you're into these perversions, in which case i would suggest surfing the net for the material.oh and on a technical note, the camera work is jerky and pans/zooms way too fast (like 70s cheap flicks). seems as though they only had one camera to work with..ma mere, ma trashKristine
