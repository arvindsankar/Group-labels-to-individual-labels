I played Little League way back when, and this movie is pretty true to my experience. The parents are all into it, and their competitiveness rubs off on the kids. If a kid isn't good, he gets beat up by other kids. Hey, this is what makes America great, right? It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, and hitting that home run is basically no different than selling that house, getting that raise, or getting into that country club.Those considerations aside, baseball is a wonderful sport (much better, in my opinion, than football and basketball.) It has a grace and honor all of its own. And the lessons you learn playing as a team are what really count.A highlight of this movie is the team manager's insistence on risking the championship by letting the "bad" kids play.Another highlight is a kid deliberately letting the opposing team get a home run after his father/coach loses it and hits him on the field.The juvenile delinquent kid trying to pick up the ballerina was a classic scene.One of the charms of this movie is that the kids -- many of whom look so innocent and angelic -- are foul mouthed, talking back to the adults and making racist and sexist comments.Why is this not offensive? Why is it refreshing? Because we live in a politically correct (read: dumbed down and hateful) age in which the ultimate sin is to offend anyone -- even those who have it coming. But only because of that.Walter Matthau is perfect as the alcoholic coach who finally cleans up his act a little bit and gets back in the spirit of winning.The classical music that goes along with movie is wonderful, even though that might seem to be an odd choice of music for a movie like this.There is really no way to convey the delight of this movie through words. You just have to see it. Would I show it to my kids? Mmm. Don't know about that. But it sure is fun viewing for adults!
