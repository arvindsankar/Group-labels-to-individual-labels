I got this movie because of the box art. It looked interesting, like a nice little romantic comedy. The tag line even looks like a comedy. But what really looked cool was Harvey Keitel on the cover.So I paid for the video, went home, and was all set for a good movie. The movie then played. The movie finished. I don't think I'll ever pick a movie by the bow cover again.The movie has perhaps the most uninteresting and unlikeable characters ever. Natural Born Killer's Mickey and Mallory were at least interesting.The plot itself mainly revolves around two or three, maybe even four main plot points. The rest of it is just filler leading up to the quasi interesting.Keitel's and Winslet's performances aren't bad. They worked with what they got. What they got was Holy Smoke. I don't like summarizing, and I don't think I'm allowed to , so I only give my opinions. And in my opinion, don't waste your time on this.
