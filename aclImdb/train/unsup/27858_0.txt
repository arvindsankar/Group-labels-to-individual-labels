The film has everything you'd want it to have. Especially if you're British. Probably more of a bloke's film, but still fun for everyone.The story is brilliant, and so accurately welsh. Every minor detail adds to the whole experience. The film progresses like a serious drama and seems to come out with brilliant comedy without even trying. As well as the actual storyline being funny, little quirks about each character and even the attention to welsh detail makes you laugh.Not only is it well written, it's also beautifully filmed, and makes great use of the camera. The film encompasses a huge range of interesting shots.Enhancing the film further was it's great choice of cast. All the characters were perfectly conveyed, and film avoided any bad performances.The music is also something to listen out for, as it stands out as a good piece of work on it's own.I highly recommend Twin Town (especially if you're British), as it's an exciting film experience with a great story, interesting shots, decent actors, and appropriate use of excessive swearing and violence.
