I have to admit that the ending of this Hitchcock film surprised me.I am usually pretty good at picking up clues but I missed 2 large ones in this film.The first is the story told by the murderer, I believed it. The story was told in flashback, it may be a lie. I have seen most of the Hitchcock films and the innocent are virtually always just that, innocent. It just didn't occur to me that the story might be a lie.The second clue is the fact that the heroine fell out of love with the murderer and into love with the detective. This should have clinched it for me but I missed the meaning completely. Heroines do not fall out of love with heroes, unless there is a very good reason.This film is a bit subdued due to the fact that the murderer could not give himself away until the end. I thought that it could have had a more intense climax when his guilt was revealed.I give it 9 out of 10 due to fact that it surprised me.
