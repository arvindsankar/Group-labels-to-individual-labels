What a load of pretentious, pompous nonsense this flick is.Dear oh dear......absolute rubbish.The movie begins with someone being murdered in a French museum, and there then follows a unbearably tedious 'detective' trail with people having murderous intent and the hypothesis is Jesus had a wife, children and there exists a present day blood line blah, blah, blah.... Yawn....Without exception every actor/actress given ridiculously hammy and unconvincing performances.But every one of them seems convinced of their own self importance. Yawn.....The movie goes on for over two hours, but it seems like two years, and I fell asleep in it several times. Yawn.....If u can't get to sleep watch this as you will be slumbering within minutes:1/10
