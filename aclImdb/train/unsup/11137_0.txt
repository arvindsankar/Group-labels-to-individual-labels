Lindsay Lohan was cute as a kid and as a teen, but personally, I didn't think she was that good. As she grew up, I think she became a better actress. Life-Size is probably above average. I used to hate it and think it was really lame, bad plot, blah, blah, blah, but after reading all the comments on the first page, it really got me thinking. The plot IS original yet simple. Tyra Banks DID do a fantastic job as Eve. The movie WAS pretty funny. Now I've realized that the movie was good and the actors all did a good job.
