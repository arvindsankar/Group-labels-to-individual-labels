Caught this Movie on the TV early one morning. The synopsis sounded promising being a Los Anglino with some history in the music biz and having some first hand experience with "Has Beens" colliding with "Soon To Be Has Beens" and their actress girlfriends and wives.This movie sucked on so many levels.Bad writing, bad lighting, bad sound editing, bad make-up, bad.. bad... bad...One scene where two fawning fans appear unannounced at a rockers door was just plain awful.And (**spoiler, maybe**) when Ally Sheedy's character is talked into wearing a painters smock on a first date (she's a designer for God's sake!) by a just befriended "housekeeper" ( she can afford a housekeeper and is THIS stupid!!!?) The more I think about it there was a real dislike for women in general throughout this whole flick.I will say that for one of these "Lookee, musicians acting like musicians!!!" vanity projects it wasn't as bad as Paul Simon's "One Trick Pony". But that ain't saying much.
