The acting was good, the picturing of that time was OK. But! Sick movie producers alert! After 30 minutes there is this horrible scene where young Nero has a sexual relation with his mother, and they show everything. I don't care if they want to show Neros sick mind, I don't need pedophile flirting in movies. You can tell such things in a movie without tongue kissing and breast sucking thrown into the face of the watcher. I turned the movie off and I suspect I'm not the first doing so.Don't see this movie. Watch something else.
