This has got the be one of the least entertaining movies I've seen. Absolutely never ever had as little a shy smile on my face, there just aren't any jokes worth laughing about in this movie.Both Vince and Jennifer's characters are not appealing to me. They are flat, undimensional and tiresome.The antics shown are also completely un-inspired.I was very disappointed by this movie.The only thing I found refreshing, and here be spoilers, is that at the end, very UN-American, they don't get back together again.But that isn't enough to warrant this movie a viewing.
