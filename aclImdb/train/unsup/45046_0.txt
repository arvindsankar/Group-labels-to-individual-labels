Verily, this Ranketh Low and Wretched.Not even fun for gamers - makes the old Mazes & Monsters (an early Tom Hanks made for TV bomb) seem like Lord of the Rings by comparison. Orcs could put on a more enjoyable production.Senseless plot. Confused gamer crashes into a tree after playing a role-playing game. Host of the game loses his job and is harassed by the police and news-media as a direct result. Confused? I sure was.Normally, people driving home late at night and having an accident would not lead authorities to attack the people/friends where the person was driving from unless there were Drugs & Alcohol involved and some sort of witnessed connection. Zero evidence of foul play, folks. Zero evidence of Logic, too.When actual murders begin, police become clueless and merely ask a couple of questions of the already destroyed Game Host.Whatever "action" occurs is just too murky even to make out. It's that badly shot.To sum it all up - Terrible Dialog, Abysmal Line Delivery, Truly HORRIBLE lighting and filming, and Zero Acting ability from all involved. And a hopelessly amateur plot to top it all off. What a complete mess!
