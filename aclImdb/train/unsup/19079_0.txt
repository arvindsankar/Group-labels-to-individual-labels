i really enjoyed the movie and i cant see why so many people didn't.i found the direction amazing,and that combined with a great photography gave people really creepy scenes.(i went to see it expecting to be scared,and i left with the amount of fear needed in these films).Though i must admit there were some scenes i could do without i didn't enjoy reno as much as i expected,but i do believe he made a good performance.the girl (anne) and the young cop really caught my attention,i was thrilled to see them perform,especially the girl was perfect for the part.i do believe they made a very hasty end though,i wanted a bigger part of the movie to happen in Instanbul.apart from that i believe its a very good movie the best part of it,has to be the atmosphere created,especially in the beginning when the movie ended i had the same feeling i had with "bone collector" and "takin lives" (i adored both of them) i really think "the empire of the wolves" has the standards to compete with these two great moviesthe political edge though makes the latter stand out in my opinion.i also think that whoever enjoyed this one will love "Vidocq" and vice versasummary-good pointsgreat movie,nice performances-very good casting,excellent photography,AMAZING soundtrack,good thriller,beautiful locationsEuropean cinema rocks once again
