Next of KinThere's a lot of potential wasted here in this story of a redneck (Liam Neeson) whose big city brother (Bill Paxton in a brief cameo) is killed by crime lords (including a very young Ben Stiller). Taking revenge into his own hands, the redneck makes the trek to the big city and there finds his other brother, a cop (Patrick Swayze), doing virtually nothing about the case. Swayze tries to stop his brother from comitting murder--vengeance is up to the law--but he won't hear any of it.This could have been an amazing sort of culture clash revenge movie fueled by some great performances (we've got a top-notch cast here!), but it's wasted because the film is (a) too long, (b) too stupid, and (c) far too inept to notice that the potential for great film is somewhere deep down below.What a disappointment.Rated R for violence and language.**
