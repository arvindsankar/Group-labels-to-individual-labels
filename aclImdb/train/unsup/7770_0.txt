A long haired guy watches as a zombie eats away on a living person. Does he run? No, instead of using logic, he simply drops his pants and proceeds to hump the zombie. She turns around and bites off his manhood or what appears to be a sausage.The actors decide to stay in a house surrounded by zombies all the while they have a car outside...The blood looks like red paint and the stuff coming out of their mouths looks like motor oil.The acting was the worst I've ever seen and believe me I've rented some real horrible grade B movies.It was a good attempt at a movie but was simply horrible... what was the purpose of dry humping a corpse anyway?
