I saw this movie a late night, and had no big expectations to it, I should have had.The story of the movie is co-written by one of the main actors in the movie, all more or less not-known. That does not however have to be a bad thing, since the story is well told, and does not hurry. The actors in the movie play very convincing and sincere.After the end-credits rolled on my TV I was quite blown away, but also started asking questions to the last 10 minutes of the movie... I couldn't make the calculation to add up. After an hour or so, I realized, that is just the way it is supposed to end, that could be a reality everywhere.I have two words for you: "See it!"
