Kirsten Dunst is a beautiful, talented actress. But even SHE could not save this dumb, plodding movie. Once again, Canadians prove conclusively that they canNOT make good films. But Kirsten? My GOD, she looks sexy, even when she issweeping a porch!!! But, if you want to see her really do her thing, watch the movie Spiderman. The kissing scene in that movie is incredibly erotic.Hey, I really like romantic movies. See "Ten Things I Hate About You" or "French Kiss" for romance. This movie? "Deeply" should have been buried, deeply, very deeply. It is pure dreck, except, of course, for the total Dunst fan, who will enjoy watching her beautiful features and amazing grace.
