I didn't like this Episode at all!!!It was a good idea to make an episode with Kelso as narrator and the salt-bunny is hilarious...but...Why??? Why the Iraq??? Come on, did they really had to chime in??? It was nothing new, nothing that didn't appear in thousands of other TV-shows etc. before.I want the "poo-musical" back!!! I think the musical-episode was the best so far. So it's very disappointing to have this episode to follow.I'm really disappointed by this episode and i'm hoping that the next one will be better....which should not be so hard!!!
