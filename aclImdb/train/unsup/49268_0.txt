This movie was okay...as far as movie adaptions of novels go but it was not accurate with quite a few scenes:1. Whatever happened to Jane's realtionship with Miss Temple and her renounsing Brocklehursts punishment against Jane?2. What happened to Rochester being the fortune teller and tricking Blanche Ingram into telling him that she was only planning to marry him for his money? Also, his talk with Jane as the fortune teller was deleted.3. Jane DID NOT tell St. John Rivers her real name when she got there. She kept Jane and told him it was an alias and that she did not want to communicate with anyone.4. Why was it never mentioned that St, John Rivers was Jane's cousin? And that John Eyre died? Or, of the letter that he wrote to Jane from Madiera or the letter she wrote back to him?5. Also, the confrontation with Mrs. Reed at Gateshead was quite important. Mrs. Reed conveyed hereverlasting disgust with Jane and told of the arrival of her uncle Johns letter many years back.This movie lacked the spunk that the book did. Mr. Rochester was just a selifish, sarcastic brute. In the book, he was these things as well as imginative and lovable. I ,as a reader, was starting to fall in love with him as Jane was too. I was disgusted by the Mr. Rochester in this movie...If you liked the book, i wouldn't see this movie.. it was a waste of my time and will be of yours also.
