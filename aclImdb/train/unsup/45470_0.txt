Oh boy! If this 'documentary' was made by a schoolchild, there's an outside chance I would have found their methods of stirring the pot funny.But, come on! What the hell do these nuts take the viewers for? Did they make it for school children? Hang on...yeah, that's it! They made it for school children. I get it now. Sure, what they are trying to do is question power...but it only just dawned on me how clever these guys really are.They have stooped to school child levels so that they can secure the attention of the young. That's good thinking. By getting young people thinking critically a seed is planted.Anyway, that's the only way this film can be praised.Overall, it's pretty childish.But hang on a minute...I heard someone say the other day that 95% of the world's population don't think...that they are infants...that the world has not progressed to adulthood.Maybe this whole documentary is extremely well targeted. Maybe 95 out of 100 people who see it will get the message.I got the message.But I thought the 'Yes' men were a bit self indulgent.They flew all over the world, they giggled like schoolgirls and they loved the camera.They hammered the nail into the wood, but at the end of the day it was a little bent.If you guys really want to stir the pot, and make us dumb viewers think...then do it better. You're the stars, you're the talent, you're intelligent and witty...make a 'The Yes Men 2' and really get your hands dirty.And for the love of everything...stop giggling and carrying on like kids in a candy store.Don't you remember anything Yoda said?"An agitator must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind...Hmph...Adventure...Heh...Excitement...Heh. An agitator craves not these things. You are reckless." Or something like that.
