The moonfaced girl from 90210 stars as God-knows-why-she's-supposed to-be-so-popular Jenny Monroe.In a mall scene, I laughed as every man's head turned to see her bad 80s hair and tree-trunk legs bulging out of yellow short-shorts.Of course her best friend is a luckless plain-jane teen mom in overalls, who actually is much prettier than the unbelievably beloved Jenny.Plain Jane was adopted, AND nobody loves her, so she wants to be a substitute daughter to Jenny's mom. Stupid, right?She obviously masterminded Jenny's murder.BUT... she did it all... for love!I don't know for sure, because I really couldn't stand this pathetic estrogen-fest masquerading for psychological drama. I was just watching it because I ran out of sleeping pills, and it sure did the trick!
