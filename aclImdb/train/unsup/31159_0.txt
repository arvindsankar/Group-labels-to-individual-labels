In a overview of Feast. I can at least say this....Don't expect your average run of the mill claustrophobic horror movie. This movie has way too much sense of humor for it to be politically correct. Don't take this movie seriously.Creatures kill whoever is convenient for them and don't expect anyone to be safe. Attacks are random and could keep you at the edge of your seat.Don't expect abuse of CGI. Classic monster costuming and effects are used.Expect the unexpected.Feast does its best to throw all Horror clich√©s out the window yet it doesn't try to be anything it is not meant to be.Henry Rollins is in this. Haven't seen him in a loooong time.I recommend this movie for the above reasons mentioned. Don't take this movie seriously and enjoy.
