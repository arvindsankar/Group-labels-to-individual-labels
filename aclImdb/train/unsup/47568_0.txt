Compared to the great Spaghetti Westerns this was a waste of time, glad I didn't have to pay for the box set. Rent firstI saw this years ago in the theater when it came out upon release and my first impression still stands. Crap compared to Leone, Corbucci, Sollima, Petroni, Damiano, and Castellari. Watch it solely for Lee Van Cleef and Linda Veras, Berger who usually can be good is terrible, its just a mindless flick. Blame the scriptwriters, two of the top villains come off looking very gay. Mental note to all, any Western where you have acrobats stay away from. Its just a piece of fluff made to cash in on the popularity of the Spaghetti Westerns. My biggest regret is that Lee Van Cleef who should have had a career boost in the US just like Eastwood didn't get one and he was forced to go with a career making some forgettable crap like this in Italy. I'm glad that he was able to become a top box office star in Europe but come on they could have made better movies. Lee Van Cleef's best films for anybody interested:Great starring roles-For A Few Dollars More, The Good The Bad And The Ugly, The Big Gundown, Death Rides A Horse, Barqueroflawed movie but good-Day Of AngerFilms with supporting roles to check out- The Tin Star, Ride Lonesome, High Noon, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Gunfight at the OK Corral
