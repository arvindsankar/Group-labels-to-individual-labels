I love this show!!! I love that it's a bit campy.Cast is great!!! I would love to see this show for more seasons.Eric Johnson as Flash is just perfect.Anna Van Hooft as Aura is very likable. She plays her part very well.John Ralston adds just enough "evil".It seems that every member is really getting into the characters that they play.I think it's way cool that they are spending so much time on developing the characters and adding new groups of people every week.The story is believable and has continuity.I'm not sure why we need 10 lines.GO FLASH!!!
