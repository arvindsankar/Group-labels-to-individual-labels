Every once in a while avid movie connoisseurs are treated to a veritably timeless piece of cinematic art.....Gone With The Wind, Citizen Kane, The Seven Samurai, Yor: The Hunter From The Future......erm OK so I lied about the last one but ye gods - you'll never forget this movie once you've watched it!In fact, this is more than just a movie...it's a life changing experience!Within the very first few seconds of this, backed by the eighties rock soundtrack you just know that your in for one hell of a (B-Movie) ride!What do you get for your money? Well you'll witness an embarrassed looking Reb Brown battling dinosaurs that are pleasantly reminiscent of those found in the late 1970's movies starring Doug Mcglure. You'll find buxom babes with barely a stitch on (always a plus in my book!) You'll marvel at witless dialogue that could have been written by a pre-schooler and basically laugh your socks off at scene after scene of (endearing) stupidity.This film is one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies I have ever had the pleasure to sit through.Two moments stand out for me especially:Firstly in one incredible scene, Yor utilises a dead prehistoric bird to hand glide into a cave and save his female companion (!!!!!)Secondly, towards the end of the movie, Yor swings across a chasm in order to plant a bomb (don't ask). However he then realises that he can't get back across the immense gap which prompts his friend Pag to perform one hell of a circus stunt in order to save the day!Both the above scenes are made immeasurably more enjoyable when the dramatic opening of the main title song suddenly blurts out during the crucial moments! - absolutely classic! I was laughing my head off!Simply put my friends, you have not lived until you have witnessed the cinematic marvel that is Yor: The Hunter From The Future. They just don't make them like this any more!
