When you can't afford Matthew McC, hire Josh Lucas.America's new sweetheart, Reese Witherspoon -- night now, Sandy B. -- does her best at holding this most formulaic so-called romance together.Seriously, I'd type how I REALLY feel but I just realized that I'd be wasting more time than I did WATCHING this 122 minute fiasco.If you don't see every single angle coming, then you might as well stop seeing films.Utter trash.And I'm not certain that a single stereotype goes unwrapped.Reese, you're better than this.But after "Legally Blonde" and this, you might have to re-prove yourself.3/10
