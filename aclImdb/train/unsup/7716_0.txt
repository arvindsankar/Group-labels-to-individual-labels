I Like ManiRtanams moviesBut Geetanjali is something different and its a class of its own in the sense even if you see after 15-20 yrs its still looks fresh story. all the characters Justified it. They are lively and well suited.Ilayaraja supplimented this with excellent music.Girija acting in her first movie was the center of attraction as she suited for the role and acted very professionally.I wonder not to see her again in films. Nagarjuna did his job perfectly but the credit goes to the director who portrayed these roles and refined them.Hats Off Mani Sir. Expecting more from you like these classics.
