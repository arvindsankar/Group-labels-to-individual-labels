If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest.Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys.The acting was bad.The story was ludicrous.Every scene was basically the same.A conversation among several women about how bad men suck.So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem.Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one.I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this.I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life.Please.
