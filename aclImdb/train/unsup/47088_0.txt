Rubbish - Utter rubbish Why?- Its not a comedy - Its Bad Acting - Not Storyline - Makes as much sense as my cat does - The characters are out of character - BADLY ADVITISEDYeah - The list goes onThis IS NOT what French and saunders are used to doing, they should stick to making great comedy's like Ab Fab, Vicar of Dibly. Not this Rubbish.Kill this series before it gives the great British comedy a bad name. Seriously, my dog is a better source of comedy when it is asleep!
