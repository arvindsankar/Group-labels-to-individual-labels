This film is the worst film of the year so far.The whole film seems rather disjointed and is unbelievably dull.It consists of bad written script and broken storyline, poor soundtrack, too many bad quality special effects, humble acting.I have read the book after watching a movie and got some clues about the original plot. Book is excellent, but it does not make a film better. I guess film only was based on the book, and truly fails to deliver any storyline. I would say most of you could skip "Nochnoj dozor" and save your time and money. So Bad It Hurts!
