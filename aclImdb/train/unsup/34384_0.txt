belongs in the category 'better never done'.dreadful writing, horrible directing and wooden acting. it feels like the actors were wheeled out on stage, given their lines, filmed, and then wheeled off.i get the feeling most of the fantastic non-acting talent that made the series so wonderful had gone missing from the production. no wonder why.doesn't come close to any of the great "classic" two-part episodes done in the salad days of the series.what a disappointment.well, i guess the only redeeming feature i can think of is that they bring the replicators back. shades of better days!oh, and the use of arnold's original theme -- nicely scored, if nothing else.
