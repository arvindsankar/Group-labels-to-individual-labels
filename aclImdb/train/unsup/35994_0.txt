Lucy Lawless must have needed a payday very badly to sign up for this opus.Genetically enhanced locust (created by the evil military) are terrorizing the countryside, and the evil military only seem to want to consider chemical or nuclear options to fix it.The plot is moronic, the characters wooden, the acting bad, and the special effects look cheap.This is the worst piece of drivel I've seen in years. There is nothing to recommend it. Avoid at all costs.Xena, where are you when we need you?
