Lets go to japan and hang around in different parts of the hotel.Then lets go out to the street and see, "whoa, this is different from America"!People don't talk English! Signs are not in English! People sing karaoke! People eat different food than in America!OK, lets go back to hotel room, and talk about our relationship that has lasted two days, and if we should go back to America. After all, that's where the family is.I decided, we are going back to America, it is a better place after all.This trip to japan was very educating, the view from my hotel room was great.
