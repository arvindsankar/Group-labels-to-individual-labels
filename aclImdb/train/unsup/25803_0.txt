I love this movie.First saw it quite a few years ago and now it's just been on MGM.I love end of the world movies.Looks like George W Bush may bring this love to life!Having now seen it a few times I can get to savour its elements...the way the beginning give no clue to subsequent events and the doubt some may have right through it that it's all some horrendous mistake.What a wonderful way to die!What a great way for Los Angeles to end!The cast and direction and music are outstanding.
