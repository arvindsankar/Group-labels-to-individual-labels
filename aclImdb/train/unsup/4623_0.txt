If you where run over by the Miramax foreign film juggernaut, then you missed this brilliant gem tucked away in one those twenty seats cinema theater.A film is very much like a painting, meant to be seen not discussed or explained. So let us just leave it at 'see it'.Benito Zambrano's talent on the other hand merits more than a discussion. A sensitive director and a poignant writer. In many ways 'Solas' reminded me of another gem in the dust 'Heavy'.Benito managed to keep the movie so simple, that it hurts. His flare for observing and then relaying in his film the raw human angst, is inspiring.The actors for there part, rose to the greatness of the moment.BZ makes us cling to hope by our finger nails while steadily adding to our feet the weight of reality. But then, isn't that life!To look for hope in 'Solas' is to look for simplicity in 'Guernica'. It's there, you just need to see it.And like all good things in life this one is elusive too. No video or a DVD release yet.Once again, it lives up to it's name.
