that even my heart went down to 20 bits a minute. But, lets not forget the score. The composer just played a few random cords for 2 hours and... voil√°, we had a complete movie!The best extras... the silk worms.I give it a 2 because the photography was OK, though I don't think this is enough reason to make a film of this caliber.If you feel like to have a very, very relaxing, boring movie session, by all means, go to see it.Blessings!ClearDawn*
