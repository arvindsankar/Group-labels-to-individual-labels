Having just seen the terrific Fahrenheit 9-1-1, I was lookingforward to this film. Alas. "The Corporation" is not really a film; it'sa seemingly endless parade of monologue snippets with patheticgraphics in-between. In short, this is not a film. It reminds one ofmid-20th Century "educational" films, but is not nearly asinteresting. Ninety-five percent of this film is common knowledge(and if you don't know that corporations have taken over everything,then you are part of the reason why we have the evil governmentwe have). Five percent contained new information. Alas, this filmhad no editor worth his or her salt. It was dreary beyond belief andafter two hours, my friend (who reached the same conclusion as Idid, but totally separately, since we do not talk during movies)looked at me, we got up and made our escape. Michael Moorehas proved over and over that politics and information do not haveto be dull. He knows how to use images to make his point. Thisdocumentary-maker doesn't.
