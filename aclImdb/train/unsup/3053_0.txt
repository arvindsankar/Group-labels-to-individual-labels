Basically. This movie could easily turn out to be real - hell, I won't be surprised if something like this has already HAPPENED somewhere in the world (most likely it has).Me and my sister showed this movie to our little brother because he's been caught stealing SEVERAL times from the family business - so we made him watch this and he rather-ed enjoyed it until the killing came along. And we could see it in his eyes, he did begin to think 'what if... that was me'.What was great about the movie is that it wasn't too predictable nor was it too complex to for a 14 year old to follow.After watching the movie we lectured him about how a simple theft can lead to more and more crime, and eventually - your life being taken away.So, not only was it enjoyable - I it was also rather educational.
