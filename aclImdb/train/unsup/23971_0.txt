What more can be said? Wonderful stuff, MUCH better than the hundreds of films etc jumping on the HK bandwagon after the success of The Matrix.Dacascos deserves much better than the dross he's been in up until now - hopefully Brotherhood of the Wolf will net him some more major roles.Finally, if you can play it - track down the UK (region 2) HKL/Medusa Director's Cut DVD - it's the full, much superior uncut version of the film with the original soundtrack. Plus there's a ton of great extras and a hilarious commentary track.The only way to watch Drive!
