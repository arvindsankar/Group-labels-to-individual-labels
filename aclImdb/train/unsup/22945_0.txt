There are only two reasons for people to rate this film higher than a five. They are either Bela Lugosi fanatics who are blinded by his star power, or they're pulling your leg.In it's favor, this film has the following curiosities: Bela Lugosi in a rare non-horror leading role. Hattie McDaniel in an early screen appearance (although running around yelling "Lordy, Lordy" doesn't showcase her future greatness very well).A curious 1935 vision of television that doesn't seem to need cameras at the point of origin and can act as a "death ray" carrier wave. I guess that makes this a science fiction story, of sorts. And occasionally interesting story-telling by reshowing the same scene using different vantage points to add information withheld earlier in the film.Working against this film is: The poor print quality (both picture and sound)of existing copies. Insulting racial stereotyping. (As implied above.) Ridiculously inaccurate scientific predictions about television. (As implied above.) Undeveloped characters, giving the audience a "who cares" feeling when someone gets murdered. And a general weakness of the writing, acting, and directing. Being a Lugosi fan myself, it pains me to write negative reviews of some of his films. But the truth is, it pains me to watch some of his performances as well. I'm giving this film three stars, based on the curiosities mentioned above. If I were to rate it any higher, I'd be pulling your leg.
