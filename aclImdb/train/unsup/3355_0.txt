I loved this movie. It's too bad that Pamela Smart does not take any responsibility for any of her crimes and actions. She is as guilty as anyone can be. I'm glad she ran out of appeals and legal options and that her pardon was denied. She took them to the Federal level. She says she deserves leniency because she's been good in prison. I don't know about you but I think people are supposed to be good in prison. Chad Allen was great in this movie.Reasons Pamela smart is guilty: 1. She had an affair with a teenage boy.2. She is a sociopatic liar.3. She is cold hearted.4. She did not show any emotion when her husband was murdered.5. Denial.6. Knew everything about the crime.7. Jury and evidence found her guilty.
