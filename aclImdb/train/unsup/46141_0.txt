This is filmed theater and does not cut it as a movie. It just does not come across with any realism or vibrancy.The point is not that a film must have action. Indeed, one of my all-time favorite movies is "My Dinner with Andre", which consists entirely of a dinner conversation between two old friends. But "First Monday in October" just doesn't have any spark.3/10
