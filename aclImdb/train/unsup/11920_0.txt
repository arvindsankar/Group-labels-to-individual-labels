Surprisingly funny movie with the dynamic duo Martin/Hawn.The movie brings to life the differences between the American cities and the countryside. Even if these exist, they are seldom brought up in the rest of the world.This plot gives a warm feeling inside and brings up real problems and thoughts with comic twist.
