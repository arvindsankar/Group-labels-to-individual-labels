Geez, even the "American Pie" movies are better than this. "Cemetery High" is just a pile of garbage that comes at the end of the barrell of 80's trash.The humor is dated, boring, some times cheesy, and I can't remember any particular scene where I chuckled or even frowned a smile.The gore is just okay for a cheesy movie like this. It's uncalled for but it's still decent.The acting is putrid! and the clich√®d characters are stupid enough to be soon forgotten.The direction looks pathetic and makes you wonder if the production would have a budget superior to 1000 dollars.I don't recommend it for anything! there aren't memorable scenes. Watch this only if you are in the mood to bash a horrible, boring, misleading movie with a decent title.Think about stupid rock tunes, horrible humor from the 80's, pathetic f/x, and horrible dialogs.Ugh. Avoid it all costs.I watched this movie years ago only because it aired on USA's "Up All Night". Good memories!
