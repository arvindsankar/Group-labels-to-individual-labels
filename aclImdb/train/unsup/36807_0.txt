I've never read any Jack the Ripper books.I've never seen any Jack the Ripper movies.I didn't even know the story behind Jack the Ripper until the other day. Then I saw From Hell. The title of the movie is ironic because it seems the movie itself came "From Hell." I will never get that 2 hours (and $8) of my life back. The movie was slow moving, incredibly predictable, and had a slow, drawn out climax.The scenery was amazing, and the special effects were fantastic. That much I'll give. Even the acting was good. It is just that the story stunk.Don't go see it. Rent it. Maybe even wait for HBO. You already know what happens anyway.
