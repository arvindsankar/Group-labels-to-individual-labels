They can be an awful film more then this? I saw the promos i was interested especially the first promo but the last few promos gave away and i hoped the film won't be as bad but the film is worstAbbas-Mustan tried to make a commercial potboiler instead just to appeal to the masses who like such nonsense filmsThe film starts off okay, 2 songs at the start itself and then slowly each characters are introduced but then the film gets boring because All characters are jerksParesh Rawal- Johny scenes are stupid and too loud and crass Shahid- Kareena scenes are worthless and boring They is little hope when Isha is murdered but the director is too involved with comedy, romance and nothing makes sense in the endThe Johny- Tanaaz finding a dead body in the briefcase is too childish and then the entire investigating scenes are not that greatBut the end takes the cake, one of the worst climaxes ever Even the CID episodes have better culminationAbbas-Mustan give their worst ever film Music is goodShahid and Kareena who were a pair that time are truly wasted Shahid just keeps making big eyes trying to look funny and make weird noises while Kareena irritates Akshaye imitates his dad Vinod Khanna at places and is the only actor worth mentioning here Tanaaz and Johny overact Paresh Rawal overacts too while Payal Rohatgi and Isha are dismissal Upen Patel with a dubbed voice is painful rest are poor
