I saw this movie at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival "www.bifff.org" in March 2006This movie is a real kick in the face, a ballet of music, feelings and poetic vision of life. Something between David Lynch and The Yellow Submarine of the Beattles. The hero is falling into desperation and will meet god for a little interview.Please take that ride ! You will not regret it. This movie is full of pleasure and humor and you will probably cry or laugh ...Thanks BB
