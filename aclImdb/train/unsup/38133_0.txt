This movie fits poorly with the first and tries too hard to link itself with it.The acting is medium to bad. Little feeling and hardly engaging.The plot is lame as I could predict every person who was killed and in what way at every interval. Besides completely destroying the mood of the first film, this one adds sex and profanity. Both are highly out of place and are obviously stuck in to get more viewers.Gore and sex do not a movie make.I don't have any idea why a Native American character was forced into the plot. It was odd and seemed like a purposeful ethnic diversification of the movie. Lame.One plot note: Satan kills the two guys in the news van early on, infuses 'Mikey', and promptly disappears from the plot.The first one is better, much better. Overall, very poor. 1/10
