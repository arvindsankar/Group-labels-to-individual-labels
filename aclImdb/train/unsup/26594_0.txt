Bram Stoker's Dracula -------------------------------------------------Nosferatu -------------------------------------------------------------The Lost Boys ---------------------------------------------------------Fright Night ----------------------------------------------------------I have this thing for Vampire movies and I've got to say, I believe this one was a classic.Although it may not be so intriguing to those who are looking for an intellectual movie, if you like old classics, this may be the movie for you.Completed with comedic lines, gore that just doesn't impress the people of the millennium, and a classic Crypt Keeper ending twist, Bordello of Blood is a good watch.
