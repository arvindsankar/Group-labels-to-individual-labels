I love survivor its like a horror movie only no one dies. Theres always that question who's next.I do not really think of it that way but that is how my Review is written. Outback was the 1st season i stayed with. Season 2. The first episode premired and after the challenge Kutcha went. This is why that person went.1. Debb-Well she was an outsider she was a loner off by herself and bossing people around being an enemy with Kimmi. 1st Kucha member2. Kel, what a scandel Beef Jerkey that was grass. Enough said. 1st Ogakor Member3. Marilyn-The slow older woman, She couldn't keep up even Tina voted for her. 2nd Ogakor Member4. Mitchell, Whoa Kucha's 3rd consecutive immunity. He was Jerri's friend so Tina, Keith, and Colby pounced to get him out. 3rd Ogakor member5. Kimmi-Sob the winning streak is over and my favorie survivor is sent home because of a fight with Alicia. She was voted anonamously. 6-1 2nd Kucha member.6. Mike-Burned and sent home. Sad 3rd Kucha member7. Jeff-Kutcha and Ogakor have merged and there is a double 5-5 tie. Jeff has 2 votes Colby has none. Jeffs votes were from Kimmi and Debb. 4th Kutcha member.8. Alicia-A threat with a big mouth. She was to strong to stay. she is the 5th Kucha member.9. Jerri-What a B$%^^ she is voted with all but 2 votes agaist her. Good Riddens. 4th Ogakor Member.10. Nick-Lazy, He should have won immunity. 6th Kutcha member gone.11. Amber-She was so tired and was voted out because she just followed Keith Tina and Colby. The voted for her. 5th Ogakor Member.12. Roger-The likable old man. So sad to see him go. 7th Kucha member. Go Elisabeth.13. Elisabeth-Uh why!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Kucha exstinct last member gone.14. Keith-Gone, I hated him. 6th Ogakor gone. Go ColbySecond-ColbyWinner-Tina-Why Tina! did they mix up the votes and vote who they wanted out. Oh Well.Possibly the best season of Survivor. 10/10
