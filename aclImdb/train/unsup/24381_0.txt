Amazingly awful! With a story as deep as a kiddie pool, we're exposed to black ops stupidity as an entourage of B-movie standards leads us through a tour in Nam'! Can't get any more badass than that huh? Wait...there's more! Vietnamese hookers that look Mediterranean! Still with me? A guy gets a spear to the nuts! Don't get up for air! I'm not finished! Jesus fights off middle aged punks in a hotel lobby, then proceeds to murder an army of dogs and highly explosive buildings! Then all of the sudden...Woody "The Man Hammuh" Strode!See this movie or die unfulfilled! Buy it or else Italy can't make movies anymore!Yours and mine,The Lazy Southerner
