There's a proverb in Tamil "Kannal kanbadhum poi. Kaadhal ketpadhum poi" It means, "Things u see with your eyes are illusions. Things you listen with your ears are all lies" This movie is like tat... Impossibly the worst movie...I saw this movie... The tile of the movie is "Godfather"... But, the story has no connection to the title at all... Guess, the director doesn't know the meaning for Godfather...TO ALL TAMIL DIRECTORS... BEFORE TITLING A MOVIE LOOK FOR THE MEANING IN THE DICTIONARY BEFORE DOING SO...
