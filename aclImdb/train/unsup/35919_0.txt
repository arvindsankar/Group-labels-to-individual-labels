This movie is not funny or scary at all. It's just boring!I was intrigued ,when I first read the plot outline and saw the ratings here on IMDb , so I decided to watch it.I very rarely fail to watch a movie to the end but this time I couldn't persuade myself to watch it entirely. After approximately 45 min , I've started hitting the right arrow key. The idea is good and original. Zombie killer sheep sounds interesting. But, the story is bad and shallow.The acting is very bad if not terrible. Characters are really annoying in every sense. They're not funny or convincing at all.The director did a bad job here. I didn't find any scene to be interesting. Everything is predictable in this movie. There aren't any surprises.If you like comedies , skip this movie. If you like horrors, skip this movie. If you like bad movies , skip this movie 'cause it's "bad" only in negative sense.If you like boring movies then I suggest you to watch this movie. You'll be bored to death!
