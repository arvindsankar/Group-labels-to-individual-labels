I've heard about how awful Pauly Shore's humour is. This film easily and quickly confirmed that.This film is a horrible parody of a great film, "12 Angry Men". It disgusted me to see such a great film treated so.You are better off steering clear of this film. If you are interested in a quality drama, just watch "12 Angry Men"; if you want a good laugh, make sure Pauly Shore is not in it.
