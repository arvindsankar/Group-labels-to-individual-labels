Legally questionable, though horrific. Anyone who hates even the concept of rape, should perhaps be sort of okay with this movie.Anyone even complicit in such an act should be guilty. And punished.But to be honest, the way this movie goes about trying legally entangle anyone present in such a foul act, is sort of forced. Not that there isn't any legal way to do it, but the way the director and writer do so, very much a question mark, and sort of a poor writing example.Not a bad concept. But to be honest. Not a very good performance. Though the individual performances are mixed. Some quite fine, some others not so much. The court performances on all sides are quite awful. Caveat: Foster is excellent. She has so much talent.
