Still i am giving the film 4 out of 10 just because of the music and some what mediocre-ly cinematography! This might be a copy of The Mexican which i have seen and loved, but some how the director has managed to make the film look very illogical! Pointless melodramatic moments! Stupid wife just keeps talking about the flooring in their new house!!Movie is crap because of the makers! If this is an first time attempt which i think it is then it is a very good attempt. The narrative is quite unique for Indian film industry standards! This itself demands respect for the makers!John acted well!!! So did Priyanka!!!! But the music and the songs are original and just plain heavenly!!!!
