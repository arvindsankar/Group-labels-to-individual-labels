To be honest, this film is basically a very poor rip-off of Finding Nemo....and is no where near as good, funny or entertaining, nor is the animation up to the same standard.The plot is roughly the same, although this time he doesn't go after his parents - even the voices sound alike!I really recommend that you don't go and see this film - even little kids who have seen other animated films (such as Finding Nemo, Shrek, Shark Tale, Over the Hedge, Madagascar, etc) may turn up their nose at this one.
