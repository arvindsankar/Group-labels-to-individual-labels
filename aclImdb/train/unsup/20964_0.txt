See this film. Its fantastic.Set in a Japanese POW camp in WW2, a group of Scots, Americans, English and Australians struggle to survive.Robert Carlyle is superb as the lively POW who longs to escape, Kiefer Sutherland is captivating as 'Yanker', the American who gets beaten up by a spade in one of the film's most powerful scenes.The show almost goes to the brilliant Ciaran McMenamin, the loner who tries to keep his morals and humanity in tact.The sountrack is hauntingly brilliant, rent this film.This is Oscar worthy in the league of 'The Thin Red Line'. Pity it didn't get a cinema release. Amazing film.9 out of 10
