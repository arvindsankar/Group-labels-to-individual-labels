i think that a religious sermon wouldn't be scared... i guess this has something similar to all king movies with more than one tale... it's cinematography is very good, and acting is not bad.it's just that it comes across lame and very cheesy... nothing to be seen here...i give my points from technical aspects...otherwise a miss... i've seen a lot worse too, but this is not a winner.the rest of the lines i'll recommend some horror-movies: the brood the uninvited the entity changeling ...those kinda movies have some depth
