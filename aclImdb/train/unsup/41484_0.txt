Loaded with clich√©s and "can see it coming a mile away" blood and guts, Dr. Giggles is a complete waste of time.Sure, the creators may have wanted to do "a genre piece", but this is the same rehashed garbage, a date movie for the stereotypical guy who laughs at the violence on screen and the girl who squeals and clings to her boyfriend. That's an insult.One of the worst things about the horror genre, seemingly coming out of the hack-and-slice 80s, is the lack of story and intelligence. Instead, sophomoric humor and one bloody situation after another seems to string us all along to the end credits.Avoid this, watch some respectful and dramatic horror that truly frightens through wit, wisdom and a compelling story.
