The summary say it all.This was the 2nd worst movie I have seen to date. #1 being I heart huckabees.This film has no redeeming qualities. The sex scenes are flaccid at best. The score overpowers the crappy dialog but not enough that you do not hear it.The "character development" was lame, and went on way too long.Felt caught between wanting to see a naked Nave and the desire to scratch my eyes out.Just like with Huckabees I kept waiting some the film to get better but alas it didn't.I have seen softcore porn with better plots, and at least most of them get you a little turned on by their sex scenes.Not worth the time even if the movie is for free, and someone else buys your popcorn, candy and drink.
