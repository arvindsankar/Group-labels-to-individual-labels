CONTAIN SPOILERS"Lord of the Piercing"is so bad,but so bad that I need to write this comment!I was watching the 2002 MTV Movie Awards and this spoof appeared.I've read about it,so I thought it would be funny.But in no way it's funny!The Spider-Man version also featured in MMA was cruel,but you could laugh.This one is 3 times more cruel,and completely unfunny.The writers should be thinking:"Oh,let's parody Lord of the Rings,with the worst kind of comedy and make people laugh".It didn't work with me.I can't believe that some people(including Peter Jackson and Elijah Wood)actually liked it!LOTR:The Fellowship of the Ring didn't deserve this,and Tolkien must be shaking at his tomb.Grade:-1/10
