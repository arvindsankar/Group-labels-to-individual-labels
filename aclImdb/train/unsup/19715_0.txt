I really wanted to love this movie. It had a great cast and John Landis! But This is not a Landis movie, just some sub-par Tarantino-likestory, lazily executed, where annoying nightmares takes up the role ofthe disjointed-time sequences you find in any Tarantino wanabee (Andthere are already too many of 'em). It seems that the cast and Landiswere so happy to work together that they didn't care about the endproduct. Unfortunately, that's what we viewers have to endure. It's notTHAt bad and the acting is really energetic, but it all seems wasted.Now, if Mr Joe Dante would just give us another of his zany, wonderfulmovies, I'd be a happy P
