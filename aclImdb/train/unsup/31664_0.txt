This film is a comedy about how the writer Hrabal was born.

The story is a kind of nostalgia, but is stillamusing tale, with not much tension and thriller, but still worth to watch(If you have a good copy of it...) At a time  I think  in the eighties the film won a some prize in a Film Festival, in Europe
