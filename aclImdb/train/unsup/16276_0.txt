I gotta disagree completely with 'mgmax' of Chicago.I watched it on TV very recently. This was the 2nd time it has been shown on the ABC (In Australia). I recommended it to everyone I know- sounds cheesy I said, but it's worth watching. Why? For Rupert Everett, that's why.This movie is all about Rupert Everett. Forget all that stuff about the plot- this is Sherlock Holmes for Christ's sake!. Everett is simply great as Holmes. The film has got some great one-liners, some are quoted on the website.Sit back and enjoy the best Holmes ever.This one goes into Holmes' drug taking as well.We don't see enough of Rupert Everett. I just watched the Comfort of Strangers- now that's got a thin plot.
