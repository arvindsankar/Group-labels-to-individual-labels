When I was 9 years old someone brought over this movie and we watched it. I sat through the entire thing.At the end the credits rolled up and in my innocent 9-year old voice, I proclaimed that this was the 'Worst Movie Ever Made!'I am now 17 I have never seen the movie again I stand by that assessment.Stupid, poorly acted, poorly directed, destroyed a reasonable book Highly unrecommended
