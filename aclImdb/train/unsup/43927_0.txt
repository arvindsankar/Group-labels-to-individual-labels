the movie was bad, couldn't understand half the words, movie was too long and contained random inappropriate scenes in an attempt to recapture the viewers attention.there was fast cars, high class but, there were never really used , only 2 shooting scenes, and 1 car scene.This movie was a waste of money and time, i will like to see how much profit is made!also, if you do decided to go to this movie, it would be wise to take a book with you ,as you will get bored. The characters as well, need to speak more clearly..
