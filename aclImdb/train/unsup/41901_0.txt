I saw this at the video store and it caught my eye. Ooooh I told myself, look at these awards, this could be a low budget B-movie worth watching. Boy was I wrong.This film was written bad, the actors did a bad job, the story was... well how can I put this...LAME!!I couldn't believe how boring and how bad the acting and story was all at the same time. Do not waste your time with this movie.If you are watching this for horror, don't bother. If you just want something bad to laugh at, this may be for you that is if you don't fall asleep.Directing - F; writing - F; Acting - F; story - D; Over all movie F-
