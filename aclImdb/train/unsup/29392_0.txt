Has everything. Whitney acts better than Costner, but great story and well made.Loved the references to Yojimbo.Good country scenes with the father from the Waltons. The characters rang true.The jealousy of Rachel's sister rang true and added another dimension to the movie.And then there is the music. Incredible. Made the best use of Whitney's voice. Most movies age, but in 2009 it still felt contemporary.1 point dropped for Costner's acting. He is wooden in a number of scenes and doesn't seem to choose the best delivery for each line.
