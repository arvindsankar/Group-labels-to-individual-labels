this movie corrupted all that was good about the hobbit.the music was frightening.the script was a product of too many late nights of white lining.it gives you a brief, misleading summary that not even a child could enjoy.at least it is better than Ralph Bakshi's LOTR.apologies to those who actually finished watching the movie.
