Robin Williams didn't outdo himself in RV. Instead, he used the same old tired failure and called this a movie. It was not a movie. It is garbage. I wouldn't waste my money to see it again if I knew before how sorry it was. Obligagatory Note: Robin Williams did excel at two things in this garbage:(1). Robin Williams sucked royally (2). Robin Williams made reference to Karl Marx andCommunism like it is a good thing. This garbage had a weak plot, weak characters and it couldn't even be called slap-stick comedy. It was certainly not clever and original.
