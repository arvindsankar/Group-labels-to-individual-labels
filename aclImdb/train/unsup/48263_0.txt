Despite the endless violence, I nearly fell asleep.Traci does her best playing a feminist hero here. And to be fair, the whole cast gave their all. But the director REALLY goofed.Piling car chase after fistfight after senseless killing on top of each other will not guarantee a thriller. It seemed that they just decided to kill several cops when they couldn't think of anything better to film.Angelo Tiffe made a great villain here. You did want to see him die. But early, so you wouldn't have to watch this heap of celluloid.And whose idea was it to put classical music on the sound track? It did not help.Violent and boring. Bad combo people.
