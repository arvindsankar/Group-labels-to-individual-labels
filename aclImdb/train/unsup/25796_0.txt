Run do not walk from this terrible disappointing excuse for a movie!If you want to see a real piece of cinema about Nuclear War, then get yourself a copy of one of the following: American movies "The Day after" & "Testament" or the British films "War Game" or "Threads".Miracle Mile has to be the worst Nuclear War Movie to ever be made.Unrealistic, Terrible effects, None existent plotlines, Just terrible...... If it comes on TV and the other channels offer nothing then just maybe watch it.... Of course Im sure you have QVC!
