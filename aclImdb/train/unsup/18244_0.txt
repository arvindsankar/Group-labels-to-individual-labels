This is one of my favorite sci-fi shows, but I certainly recognize its flaws.The Good:* the concept---> I liked the historical context of the 12 tribes of Kobol, the Pearl Harbor-like attack, the "ragtag fugitive fleet" seeking Earth. This really framed the series well.---> The look of the Ceylon base ships and the bat-wing Ceylon fighters was terrific. I also liked the look of the battlestars and Colonial vipers. The command center of the battlestar seemed believable.* the casting:---> Lorne Greene as Adama brings a commanding screen presence---> Richard Hatch as Apollo is well-cast and believable as a leader/captain of a fighter wing---> Dirk Benedict as Starbuck the amiable sarcastic sidekick ---> John Colicos as Baltar oozed evil with perfection---> other minor cast members like Herbert Jefferson Jr as Boomer and Terry Carter as Colonel Tigh were very well cast too---> I thought the three most visible female characters were all good, though not standout. Maren Jensen, Laurette Spang, and Anne Lockhart just also happened to be beautiful too.---> visiting cast members like:-------> Lloyd Bridges as Commander Cain was truly memorable-------> Patrick McNee as Count Iblis was also highly memorable-------> Ray Milland and Fred Astaire were good guest stars too* the costumes---> I liked the Colonial Warrior uniforms - they still have a style to them today. I liked the Warrior helmets with their Egyptian-like motif.---> The Ceylon warriors with their shiny armor, had a great look to them too. The red strobe they used for vision was a great menacing concept.* some episodes with great plot lines---> the return of Commander Cain and the Pegasus stands out---> I thought the visit to the "home" planet of Kobol, with its Egyptian motifs, was terrific. This is part of the pilot's introductory three episodes.---> I also liked the encounter with the Ship of Lights and Count Iblis - this was especially well done.* the music - I still like the theme song to Battlestar Galactica* the behavior of the Ceylons was entertaining. "By your command" spoken in a tinny voice was a favorite.The Bad:* some cheesy special effects (by today's standards)---> ...and reuse of the same special effects---> why was Count Iblis' crash site off-color in one moment, and clear blue the next?* quite a lot of cheesy cringe-inducing dialogue* the little kid Boxie and his robot dog* some of the episodes had really horrible plot lines, especially later in the series---> the Lost Warrior where the kids attack the Ceylon outpost---> why did Baltar return to the human fleet again?The Ugly:* the original show was cancelled after one season* Galactica 1980, the follow-on show in which the battlestar finds earth, was pretty horribleAll in all, I am willing to forgive Battlestar Galactica's flaws and remember with fondness its strengths.Rick
