- Not much to say here, and that's about exactly what this flic deserves. But I wonder what it would've been considered if released back when it was written; Just as poor or rather interesting?Well I'm a movie lover, not a movie reviewer, but I can easily say this was a dog.I bet even John & Janet were rather embarrassed by this one.Still, I watched it and found myself quite taken by Janet Leigh's beauty and enchanting eyes, along with Johnny's youthful amorousity.The plot(?) is a sham, the "Commies" are treated as the usual moron's we were taught to believe them to be in every other propaganda flic, but it still serves to remind us of a time when even seduction was innocently provocative.Return to an earlier time while viewing this comedy-that-never-was, and please don't expect to walk away with a moral, or inspired.It's just a 'cute' way to blow an hour or two, and to remember what Studs Janet and John were in their day....get the popcorn popping' and leave the Kleenex on the shelf, you won't need it for this one.
