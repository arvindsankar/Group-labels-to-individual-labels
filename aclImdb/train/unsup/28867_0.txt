A film dealing with greed and envy. An all-star cast gets us through the plot.With breathtaking scenery, Susan Hayward, as Leah, secures the aid of Cameron Mitchell, Gary Cooper and Richard Widmark in trying to free her trapped husband in a mining cave.As the husband, Hugh Marlowe steals the acting in the film. He appears to be ungrateful when freed and lashes out at Hayward for bringing him into this situation.The remainder of the film deals with the group trying to get back to civilization and away from the Indians who menace them. Of course, the bodies begin to mount.A very young Rita Moreno appears in this film in one scene as a bar room singer.Everyone seems to be aiding everyone else in the cause to survive. Interesting film but haven't we been down this road before?
