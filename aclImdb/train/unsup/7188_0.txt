I loved this movie since my family loves cats and I remember how it broke my heart when the kitty got killed. I think I remember he fed it tuna fish that he either stole from a store or from his house, I can't remember exactly how he got the cans of tuna but I kinda remember that part of the movie.I need someone to mail me a copy of the movie so I can share it with our younger members of our church.Thanks in advance, God loves a cheerful giverMail a VHS copy to :Ernie Smith 2586 Otranto Road Charleston,SC
