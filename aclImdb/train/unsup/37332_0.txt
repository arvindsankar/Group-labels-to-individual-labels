Except the horrible cast, the ridiculous script & the lousy dialogues:Did the author only read ONE scientistic book about climatic structure, tectonic plates, or just physics? Never saw a more ridiculous movie.Better to spend the money for renting to me. :-)Why is it not possible to vote zero?No movie in the last years would deserve it more!AND: Which drugs are necessary to write a script like these? Which people are financing this waste of time?Worst movie of the last years!
