Extremely well done...In the form that it was, after the event as it were...Quite startling.Many names 'in the know', which added much credence.I was particularly struck by David Kay's comments: Obviously a man of high principle-Presumably choosing David was one of White House's unexpected blunders...I cannot imagine Bush choosing a man of integrity by design! I sincerely hope David has not been singles out for his honesty.I wholeheartedly recommend this documentary to those who wish to know the truth about this abhorrent war & the true reasons for it.
