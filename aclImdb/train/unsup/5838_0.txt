When I saw the film with my lover he said, "Who knew he could preach!" when Duval performed his final sermon. It is an awe-inspiring performance. I am a pastor's kid and my father was good, Duval shows greatness. In the film Duval's character is deeply flawed but also deeply faithful. What makes this film great is a clear view of evil to redemption to punishment to resolution. In 97 there were only two truly moral flms. Very different films. Boogie Nights for family values and loyalty, and The Apostle about redemption. What and incredible year with two profound films in the same year.
