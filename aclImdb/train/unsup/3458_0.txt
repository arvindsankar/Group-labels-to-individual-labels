I have seen the bottom 12 IMDb movies, and I can safely say, this is worst! Some brainless people (most probably the makers of the film) have rated this a 10 out of 10, keeping it above 1.0/10.This is the most pathetic film ever and is only good for recommending it to your deepest, darkest enemies as "the greatest closet horror film ever created."I love horror films, and this is a disgrace. Not only to the movie industry, but to all mankind. Heck--to all life in the Universe.I still have a bad taste in my mouth from watching it 4 years ago.Please do not watch this film, you will forever be changed. And believe me, there is no coming back from this.Prior to watching this film, I had 20-20 vision. I am now completely blind in my left eye. My left hand had been removed and was reattached to my right foot after it was cut off for severe frostbite.Please help me.
