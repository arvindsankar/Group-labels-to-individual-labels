This show is so bad. I think Klasky and Csupo haven't heard that animation must be funny for kids. Well, this is certainly NOT funny. The animation is bad, the story is bad... and the characters are bad. Only Tito can sometimes be funny. But almost everything in Rocket Power sucks ass. A better name for it:Rocket Crash. I don't have other words for it.Because Otto is dumb and not cool,Twister is a son of a bitch,Reggie is older but NOT cooler,and Sammie is a nerd.And the plots are ridiculous, and there obviously isn't any timeline in the show. In one episode they need money, so they sell they're Shore Suck beach restaurant, but in other episodes they HAVE a cottage in the mountains, where they go to in vacations or something like that, and it's probably really theirs, since they always go to the exact same. Why not just sell that?!It's no wonder they cancelled it. It was hilariously bad and super annoying. End of comment.
