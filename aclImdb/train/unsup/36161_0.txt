Miserable, off-the-wall film dealing with Arthur Miller's supposed masterpiece.Let's get something straight. This idea that the idea of the film is to emulate the witch hunt of the 1950s is absolutely ridiculous. It's a totally different genre, people, places and misery.Are we to believe that Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen are the equivalents of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg? Are we to believe that Allen is not to be put to death for practicing witchcraft right away because she is with child and we know the church's position on abortion?With it all, there is a very good performance by Paul Scofield as the chief magistrate.Hypocrisy is shown by most of the characters here, especially Bruce Davison. He portrays a priest who is as phony as they come.I love the way the town people turn on one another. Perhaps, Elia Kazan should have directed this film.Among other things, this film is boring, Winona Ryder screams like the holy lunatic she is supposed to be. What's so magnificent about Daniel Day-Lewis here?
