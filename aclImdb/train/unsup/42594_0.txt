Starts OK. But... Then all goes downhill. Reminds me too much of the Swedish TV series (3 parts) 'Dödspolare'. I do not want to spoil the plot, far from! But if you like films where bad turns to worse only to end at...The movie hits rock bottom, and starts to dig.The only positive I can post is; Jack performs excellently! As always!If you like this kind of movie, you must see 'Dödspolare'!
