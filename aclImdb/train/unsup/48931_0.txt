While eventually the meek are supposed to inherit the earth, first they stop in Japan to inherit two million yen off the Yakuza and Baby Yakuza as portrayed here by the Keystone Kops.But while our two little wallflower protagonists find a whopping $2MY, the real score is in finding each other. And guess what...pretty soon, they'll be Mr and Mrs Meek.Yuck...The characters in this film lack both adrenaline and drive... The casting director I think was too good for the film's own good, and our humdrum hero and heroine just never seem to get the action, nor the romance, in gear.Granted the mousey librarian of a nurse does get a fashion makeover; who would have ever thought she was so beautiful? Eventually besides a couple of nice outfits, she adopts a bit of matching verve (swoon as she takes off her glasses and almost kisses a boy, savor as she kicks off her heels and chases down a bus).Yawn...The acquaintances to the crime are just too quaint, I feel I was the victim here.3/10
