PRC earned its reputation for bad movies, but "Border Feud" is from "The New PRC" and actually is pretty good.Director Ray Taylor was usually capable and, except for some script supervising or directing errors, this runs pretty smoothly.Al "Fuzzy" St. John would have been funnier -- seriously, he seldom makes a move that isn't at least a little funny -- if he hadn't been quite so intrusive, which is not his fault but that of the script or director.Most of the characters are played by competent to even talented actors, even though most of them never became stars.Except Al "Lash" La Rue, as it is spelled in the credits on this movie.He seldom gets the compliments I think he deserved. Really, he is more than competent although, as another commenter said, there should have been more whip work.La Rue and St. John were both very good cowboys, and "Lash" seems to have done most of his own stunt work.The score wasn't always appropriate but it was always nice music and composer Albert Glasser should have been given screen credit.To those of us for whom there is hardly such a thing as a bad western, "Border Feud," despite a misleading and pointless title, is a good one.My copy is on a disk from "The Treasure Box Collection," and, except for being a few generations too old, is in pretty good shape.There is also another Lash La Rue film, "Ghost Town Renegades," on the back side of the disk, although he is "LaRue" in that film's credits.
