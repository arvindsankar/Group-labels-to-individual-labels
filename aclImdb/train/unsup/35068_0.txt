The subplot about the low budget theatre would have made a great comedy.There were some very funny moments especially with the theatre manager and the actor who wanted Buck for a neighbor.Unfortunately the main story line was not especially funny or frightening. Chuck's wife seemed nice but boring; and Chuck and Buck were just boring.And the movie was so unpleasant to look at that it was difficult to endure.
