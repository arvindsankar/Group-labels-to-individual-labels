What a drag! I must admit at first that there were some funny moments in the film -- most notably a coffee-guzzling Bill Murray, but it wasn't enough to save it. There were several shorts that revolved around (you guessed it) coffee andcigarettes, with rather awkward encounters between cafe dwellers. Most of thedialoge was unremarkable pretension that just wasn't funny, or interesting. Some performances were good (Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, and Tom Waits) andothers atrocious (Jack & Meg White). A great idea -- poorly executed. Don'twaste your time with this -- go grab a cup of coffee with a stranger.
