I found some parts interesting. Especially the nature photography. But i found the plot and characters not interesting. The acting was as bad as it can get. The film is supposedly over a battle between men and women. But one could easily also imagine Bosnia.On the one hand a rural landscape where everything appears normal but on the other scenes of death and destruction. The long scenes in the bedroom of the ugly old lady bored me to distraction.The hordes of naked children did give a bizarre aspect: but this is a film where nothing really seems to happen. A girl who is always running seeking but never seems to find.
