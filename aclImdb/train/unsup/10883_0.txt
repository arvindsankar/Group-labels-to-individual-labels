This is an absolute gem of a series. Everything is spot-on with the acting, sets, stories. If you watch one comedy show this year then this is the one. I remember watching really bad horror series and films in the 80's and this recreates it perfectly.The characters are perfect, Dr Lucien Sanchez has got to be the best character on the small comedy screen for a while.Get the DVD as it's got all 6 episodes plus some really sketchy and random extra scenes.All I can say is get this now if you like your comedy a little weirder than normal. You won't regret it traveller.
