Though I haven't seen a lot of John Casavetes' work, apart fromthat, this is one of the best modern (read: 1985-present) uses of8mm film that I've ever seen. This is one of those films you justhave to throw yourself into. I'm not drawing a parallel between thetwo--at all!--but people who have seen 'Neon Genesis Evangelion'will recall how by the end of the first episode you had no idea whatwas going on, right alongside the principle character. This moviehas a similar feel--It's unsettling at first, but ultimately presentsitself as a curiously wonderful juxtaposition of warmth andcoldness; interrelation and alienation. Very few films are capableof doing this well. Oh, and as a side note -- this is NOT one ofthose aimlessly meandering art films hell-bent on using 8mm togenerate indie/underground credibility. In sum: a thoughtfully rewarding film about two very different German brothers lost inJapan and discovering a fine gray line dividing the point of noreturn from the point just before it and overcoming that dualism.
