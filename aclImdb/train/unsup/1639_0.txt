Bleeder is in all terms a masterpiece.It bites. It bites the viewer throughout. Covering the lives of a group of young Danes it touches you adherently.It`s raw and it`s alive.Subtle yet violent, it gently and beautifully says a million things in single frames, single dialog, single sounds and visions.Be warned; Bleeder is explosive and even gory in parts, but never unjustified. More importantly it is funny and warm and heartfelt - you`d be a lying fool if you can`t somewhat identify with some of the characters or some of the situations.Or be moved by the sheer power and heartbeat of the director and the portrayels of frustration, trauma, loneliness, friendship, stupidity and love.Well done.And no ... this is NOT a "Pusher 2" ... this is something altogether better, richer and wiser.It`s pure movie magic.Here`s to Lenny and Leo, Lea and Louise.
