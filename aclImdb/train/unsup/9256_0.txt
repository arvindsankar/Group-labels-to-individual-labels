I used to watch this show religiously. Yes, I consider it equal to going to church.Keith has a way of lightening up the news while making important points.He can be depended up to bring in the very best commentators to back up his own commentary and give us the real facts behind today's news.Yes, it has a liberal bias, but then the truth is the truth, and Fox News needs to have something to counteract the falsehoods.I enjoy Olbermann because he just doesn't take himself seriously and her certainly has fun bursting the overly inflated egos of those who do not have America's interests at heart.
