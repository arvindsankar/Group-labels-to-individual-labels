I caught this movie at its premiere at the Seattle Film Festival and it totally ROCKED MY WORLD.Great story. Funny jokes. Cool techniques. But what really impressed me was its INTELLIGENCE.Here was a movie that was actually about something. Actually it was about a lot of things: anarchy, freedom, group-think, sexual politics, and what it means to just be yourself and do your own thang.Alot of the scenes were LAUGHOUTLOUD FUNNY. Good old fashioned sharp dialogue and hilarious situations. Just when you thought you knew where it was going, it took a bizarre twist that totally shook up your expectations. And while the movie gets progressively darker and darker, it takes a while for you to realize it because the journey is so fun.Obviously this movie didn't have a budget, but it always looked really good -- without looking polished. You could tell they thought alot about the editing and the sound, because both stood out above 99.99% of other indie flicks.HUNT THIS MOVIE DOWN at a film festival or wherever and see it.It will rock your world.
