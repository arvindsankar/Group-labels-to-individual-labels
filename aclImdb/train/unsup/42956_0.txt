Someone hired a few names from the Italian horror field and thought that was enough for a passable thriller.Boy, were THEY wrong.Ricci screwed this up in every way imaginable.The effects looked like the were made by kindergarten kids using finger paints. And the tension was non-existent. The camera work was laughable. Hiding behind furniture does not make a scene suddenly scary.The idea itself was the only redeeming quality. And I usually like to see David Warbeck or Janet Agren. But the must have needed the money badly to include themselves in this piece of tripe.Blow this one off.
