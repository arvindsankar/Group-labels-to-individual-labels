Stanley Tucci is the "Woody Allen" in this film, but all the characters reminded me a great deal of the type of films for which Woody is famous.Not quite as funny as "Little City", but right up there with it.It has a cast of characters who are speaking individually from time to time to an unseen interviewer - which easily enables us to pick up on who they are, and what they are like, and what their present situation in life is, and how they feel about the messes they keep getting themselves into.There's adorably cute Tommy, a dark-haired young man, whose first sexual experience was with gorgeous Maria, but then they got married, and he started wanting every woman he saw on the street, and so he and Maria got divorced, and now he's just trying to get a date.There's Ashley who was seduced quite young by an older man, and now here she is a waitress in a coffee shop, going nowhere fast with her life, and involved with a married man, a dentist named Griffin.Griffin has a lovely wife, Annie, who is an idealist, whose first love turned out to be gay. Annie is a real estate agent who is showing Tommy apartments, since he's got to find a new place to live.Meanwhile Tommy is staying with a debonair, dashingly handsome, older man, and expert womanizer, Carpo, who gives him advice from time to time.Then Tommy meets Maria.........And it's musical romance chairs.I totally loved this film, and the characters in it, most of whom were as neurotic as any Woody Allen character ever hoped to be!I gave it 10 stars out of a possible 10. Delightful film.
