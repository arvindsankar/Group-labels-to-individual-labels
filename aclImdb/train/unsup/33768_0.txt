A quick Summary of this film: A Green Fish like Monster takes a liking to eating people 0n the Paradise island of Hawaii.With the low budget and poor acting the only watchable aspects about this film are the scenes showing the Wildlife and the Island. I managed to watch the whole film on my Film philosophy that it can only get better, Unfortuantly it Didn't!Why i gave it 2/10 instead of 1/10 shows the quality of films i have seen in my life time. I would say avoid but make your own mind up....Next
