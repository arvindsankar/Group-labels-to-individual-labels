I will say this and then be done with it.This movie is NOT a comedy. It is not satirical.It is revolting and insulting.The little actual "footage" they show is taken out of context and is both abused and misused, and the remainder of the film is simply a veiled insult.This film is a sad stab at an area of history that the writer plainly knows little about, and it is infuriating that someone might actually see this and think any minor part of it is true.0 out of 10 for this, and by now known reputation, anything else the writer might involve himself with.
