I loved this movie as a kid. It's a great suspenseful, spooky movie without any gore because of the time period it was made in. Back then they had to rely on a plot to get the audiences attention.I am desperate to buy this movie on DVD.I hope someday someone will put it on DVD.It's a treasure that should not be lost.If anyone comes across source we can buy this from, I hope they will post it to let us all know.At this point I have to fill in the 10 lines of text this thing says I have to have to post a comment :-(
