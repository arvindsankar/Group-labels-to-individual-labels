just watching this on late night FREE TV. bad acting, story, hairstyling, casting choreography, directing,,, can't even be bothered finishing the list. i love bad TV. i laugh at lame 1 liners and cheap sets. but this is just plain bad.i think the makers were going for a jean-claude/Dolph lundren type movie, but even they probably would have turned down the role. the only thing i like is the supposed tough 'mafia' guys who would make anybody they threaten laugh in their face.do not waste your money on this and if you are looking for cheap laughs you will be waiting a while.
