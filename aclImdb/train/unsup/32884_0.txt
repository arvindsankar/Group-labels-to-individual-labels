really one of the worst films in recent memory. and that is saying alot.what a muddy script and incredibly bad direction. a few people said to me that at least it looked good, but i thought it just lookedcheesy - very cliche. one dimensional characters. bad story development. totallyfractured. very predictable. badly edited. REALLY badly written. hard to tell if the acting was particularly bad (although i can saywith certainty that at least 'the partner' was really awful..) as theactors had NOTHING to work with.amazing that this made it to the big screen..did i mention that it was bad?
