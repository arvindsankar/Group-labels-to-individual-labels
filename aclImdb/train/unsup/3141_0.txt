YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: 6-track Dolby Stereo(35mm and 70mm release prints)In Victorian London, the teenage Sherlock Holmes (Nicholas Rowe) and John Watson (Alan Cox) are intrigued by a series of apparently unrelated 'suicides' which lead them to a murderous Egyptian cult operating in the bowels of the city...Enjoyable - though inconsequential - reimagining of Holmes' teenage years, which blends old-fashioned British melodrama with the demands of a US summer blockbuster. Design and cinematography are sumptuous, and the supporting cast (including Freddie Jones, Anthony Higgins, Susan Fleetwood and Roger Ashton-Griffiths) is excellent. Parents of small children are advised that some of the early scenes, in which characters are killed whilst experiencing vivid hallucinations, are genuinely frightening in places.
