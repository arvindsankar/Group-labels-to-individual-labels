I first saw this movie when I was five years old, and I LOVED it! For many years afterwards, this movie remained in obscurity to me, it seemed I was to never see it again, until one day, I put it on request. I know own it on DVD, I whenever I'm in the mood for something funny, I watch this movie! Abbott and Costello are my favorite comedy duo, they made some of the funniest movies I have ever seen! Though Martin and Lewis had beaten them out of the top ten box office in the later years, the are still considered the best.That Martin and Lewis team, they are very funny, but they cannot hold a candle to Abbott and Costello the greatest of them all! Abbott and Costello are the kings of comedy! Very Funny! 10/10
