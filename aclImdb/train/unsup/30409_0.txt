I have always been a sucker for classic comedy and this movie is great fun.I understand that the O'Toole character was based on Errol Flynn, even though he had died before this movie supposedly is set. O'Toole is great in the role.I was born in1952, so it is nice to see what fashions, cars and other things looked like in the New York of that era.The King Kayser character has echoes of Sid Caesar when you hear him.This movie is one to watch if you want something to watch on a night when there's nothing else on.George Senda Concord, Ca
