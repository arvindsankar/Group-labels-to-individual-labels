This excellent film is one of William Holden's best earlier roles...not all that far from the major stardom that was to come.This was also a nice change of pace for Robert Mitchum. It was another sturdy performance by Loretta Young. I find it entertaining, honest and well made. I do wish Warner Home video would see fit to release it on DVD. It's a good 'family' movie, and I believe it would be popular.Considering it was one of RKO's biggest hits in the late 1940's, I guess the public back then saw it the same way I see it....as a terrific film.
