Otto didn't reinvent himself with 7 Zwerge and its possible to see this in every second of this movie. If you saw a lot of the old stuff by Otto Waalkes there is not much new to explore.But the film isn't bad at all. Its only old fashioned. Otto plays himself as usual even if he tries to act as a character called Bubi and his parents.The jokes are funny as they were when Otto told them the first time and the little new stuff is pretty cool.I like the scene about "Brettspiele" very much.If you didn't watch a Otto Movie before you can add up to 2 Points to my Vote.
