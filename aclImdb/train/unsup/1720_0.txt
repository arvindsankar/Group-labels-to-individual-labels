Silly movie, but has good acting by young Sean.It is sad though that interesting stories are ruined by high paid actors. Nicole is an actress that doesn't seem to know where her talent lies. Is it comedy, or drama, or horror? I have not seen anything yet by her to indicate she is worthy of her status monetarily or with the media.She was fooled by idiot Cruise the first time, now she is fooled by a 10 year old.I give the movie 4 of 10 only because the music score is very haunting and helps to keep the viewer focused. The story could have been played better, and the ending is ridiculous.Overall, the movie has no winning quality to it and you will be disappointed if you watch it. Cannot recommend.
