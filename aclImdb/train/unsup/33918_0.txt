saw a sneak preview of this film yesterday in mumbai There are some "cheesy" moments but I'm happy to say that they are far and few between.The acting is not academy-award winning but you will be pleased with the performances.It is an engaging film that brings you into a dark and gritty underworld that actually can feel quite real at times. You feel for the lead character.One of the strengths of this film is character development.It also has some twists that may actually surprise you in a good way.I think the real downfall of this film is that it has a "Hollywood" ending. For me the film loses points for this.One final note: the climax, although still good, was pieced together in such a way that it did not hold the tension enough for the theater audience. There was laughter and some heckling in my theater.I wouldn't walk into this film expecting a ground-breaking film that will change the genre forever, but it is does have some good pacing and the story moved al
