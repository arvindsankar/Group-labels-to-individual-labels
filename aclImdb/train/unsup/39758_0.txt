You want to look away, but you can't. It was horrible- absolutely Unbelievable FX (um, yeah, intestines DON'T glow in the dark!). The CGI could've been better done by a junior high schooler with too much time on his hands!The ending was straight out of "Volcano" (1997).It's so clich√©d:people with histories being thrown back together; gov't involved conspiracies; a small group of people saving the day, with a villain trying to thwart the heroes.And of course, copy-catting a bigger film.You don't have to have a big budget to create a decent film. Tornado! which aired on Fox several years ago was a Twister copy-cat, but was still half-way decent. At least I didn't laugh my way through that one.
