zRate: 1/10This movie is flaw-ness, the director and the writer should just hang themselves for good.THE BS scene:- The woman's old house was burned when she's a kid, may be not burned down but definitely burned bad. When she and the d-Cop revisit the house, everything is in good shape, just dusty. It's like nothing has happened. Definitely stinks :(Why would the d-cop give his gun to the woman and go investigate alone without a gun?? Just because he could have two good chances to let the killer gets away. And so the movie can drag on for another hour.another BS scene:- Outside the Media Art place, where the d-cop should be ran over by the killer and died long ago!? I've watch this part frame by frame. It's impossible for the killer to make a "3-point turn" and face the d-cop at the end. To cover up, the director decided to use scene with car crashing into barrels of water instead.For those who think this movie is good or even fantastic, all I can say is u haven't watch enough good movies to make a better judgment... SAD...
