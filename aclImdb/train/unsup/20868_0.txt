Emily & Florence - Two very unconvincing "Ladies".Carol Beer - A Banker and A Travel Agent - The Computer always "Says NO"! Bubbles De Vere (and Desiree) - Bubbles is an extremely large woman - who is naked in every one of her scenes. Desiree is her ex-husband's new wife (series 3 only).Dudley & Ting Tong - Ting Tong is Dudley's new mail order "Bride".Marjorie Dawes - She takes the Fat Fighters classes.Mr. Mann, Roy and Margaret - Mr. Mann is quite picky in what he wants to buy from Roy, everything from a disappointed horse!That is only some of the great characters of the amazing show!
