A mockumentary with an alternative history twist. Great idea, but the execution was incredibly poor and lazy.The acting was simply horrible, probably among the worst ever seen outside 50's B horror movies. I kid you not. The pacing was awkward, if this was a real documentary, nobody would go through its painfully boring parts.Whoever wrote this has absolutely no knowledge about history. Sure, the message is valid... but the movie doesn't seem convincing at all. A lot of the events are so poorly thought-out, they only become annoying.All the major events in US history are there, only with a little twist, sadly, the 'twist' has no grounds in reality ( even alternative reality ).Final verdict: 2/10, only because the idea was good.
