The story is idealess.The costumes are laughable.The set and scenery are boring.The fights are simple.The main actress is good looking, the main actor is not. But both are acting bad, together with all the other actors as well.The music is annoying.The camera-work and editing are static. Special effects are rare and unconvincing.There is no climax and the end is unspectacular.All in all, there is nothing that makes this worth your time. Only for people who really wants to know about every movie of this genre.
