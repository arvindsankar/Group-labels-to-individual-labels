Actually I caught this movie on TV as I was about to go to bed, andit grabbed me immediately. Sure, it's parody and genre, but it'sother things too. It is visually eye-grabbing for a start. The oddcandy colors are partly reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz and TheKing and I, but the total effect is disorientating, colder, more highpitched: its clashing colors dominated by the piercing fuschia red,but sometimes slanting off towards yellows, or sepias and softblues. In European terms it's like seeing the paintings ofPontormo and Bronzino - a Mannerist palette on film. There is, Iimagine a lot of filtering and digital enhancement here. It'sself-conscious but no more so than any consistent vision has tobe. So the color comes first.Immediately, you are pitched in an alternative reality of westerns(Sergio Leone mixed with Zorro) and romances, but comic as the'western' scenes are, these are not merely 'cool' parodies. Thestyle everywhere refers to memory, of period, of genre: if it is irony it is a strange poignant irony in the service of poetry. The palettechanges with the genre, as does the framing. Parts of it arepresented as scenes in theaters.The story is simple enough but acute in its balance of belief anddistance. It makes sense as an adult take on the feel of childhood.I thought it marvelously original, funny and alarming. Oh far far farbetter than the vastly cerebral Greenaway whose work might makea reasonable aesthetic analogy.
