My first comment on IMDb ... after watching many IMDb Top250 ... After this I HAD to write something. One of my all-time favorites.This movie is fantastic. I have never seen a movie that let's you feel with the main actor like this one.If you see this movie, you feel the feelings the main actor has. This movie makes you curious, angry, sad, afraid and shocked like few other movies.The acting is superb and so is the cinematography.I am so glad I could watch this 'old' masterpiece. Thank you George Sluizer!
