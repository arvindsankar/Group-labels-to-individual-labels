Wow! A great movie. Well, at least sometimes.A great start, nice playing and a (nearly) foreseeable ending.But the story is good though, so give it a try. It is really difficult to comment on this movie. I just had all the time a feeling of foreseeing everything but it wasnÂ´t boring.You really have to see this one.7 out of 10 points (alternatively: 3 out of 4).
