Another good idea ruined by the TV people. "Exo-Man" is the story of a college professor who is crippled by a spinal injury during a break-in (the bad guy whacks him across the back with a length of pipe). He uses his talents to build an exoskeleton (actually a suit) to enable himself to walk - and to avenge himself on the bad guys.The movie started out OK, but the special effects were poor for 1977 and the script was horrible.If this sounds familiar, the idea was handled a bit better in the short-lived series M.A.N.T.I.S.
