Poor costuming,Bad acting,Some OK sets,and Lame plot.Not representative of the Rennaissance in it's lack of accuracy.The fantasy portion can't even begin to pull you into the story. Bad wig on Gawain. Overall the worst movie I have seen in a very long time.All I can say is Sean Connery must have needed money very badly to act (if you can call it that) in this monstrosity. Don't waste your time!
