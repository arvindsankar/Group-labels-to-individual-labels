Tries to be as cool as pulp fiction and as funny as dogma.Fails both.Does not try to find to a climax... And doesn't find it.Uses some interesting ideas already dealt with in other movies. I could not find something special or new in this film.The plot is predictable most of the time. The dialogs are trying to use a lot of bad words, trying to be cool, but are neither cool nor funny.All in all nothing more than a poor story and mostly poor actors. For me this is one of the worst movies I saw this year and I wonder how it could get that high score on IMDb.
