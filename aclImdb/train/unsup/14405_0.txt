One of the lesser Cassavetes, this one is kind of hard to figure out,but it's still worth seeing if only for Ben Gazarras performance.Playing one of those characters that you love to hate and don'tunderstand, he excels even more than usual. The plot is fairlystraight forward, and doesn't merit retelling here. I found it more ofa character study, and what a character! Shot in the usual haphazard Cassavetes style, this one packs a punch that is hard totake. In fact, it took me two days to get through it, but I'm glad I did.
