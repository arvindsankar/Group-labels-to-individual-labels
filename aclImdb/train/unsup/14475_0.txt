This new Miss Marple series had me excited. But soon after watching the first episode, excitement turned quickly to disappointment and boredom.I tried so hard to like this series because Miss Marple had always interested me. Whether they played her for laughs or dead serious, the Brits usually did a good job. Not now.The problem is that this series tries to be both cute and serious. Too many known older (and probably out of work) actors try to elbow each other out of scenes by overacting. Hey....that's not a problem because the plot does not exist. It just seems to me that this is a showcase for the parade of actors doing their skits.Jane Seymour, looking garish, is bumped off quicker than you can say "DUD." Everyone parades through with characters that aren't developed enough for you to know where they truly fit in this so-called mystery. They throw in comical sub-plots of family interactions and at one time I didn't know who was part of the family and who was the hired help. The ending is laughable. But I wasn't laughing....I was asleep.One person who gave this high marks and criticized those of us who don't, said get out a "G AND T" (gin and tonic) and watch this show. Obviously he needed to get soused to find this series appealing.I agree. Only booze can help.
