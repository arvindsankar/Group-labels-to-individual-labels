John Matthew Mathan debutted with SARFAROSH(1999) and people clapped and were amazed at how in his first film he did such a good jobNow he returns with SHIKHAR(2005)We always say a second film is a judgement day for the director and John Matthew fails in itThe main problem is actually the storytelling, directionThe film has a decent plot but it's ruinedAjay's role takes off well but his plan of making a city looks feeble also the film lacks the intensity because in between suddenly they throw in songs and other commercial ingredientsThe comedy by Sushant Singh is poorThe film goes on and on endlessly in the second half and the climax spoils it furtherDirection by John Matthew Mathan is bad Music is okayAmongst actors Ajay does a cakewalk in a negative role but his role could be far more intense, the director wanted it to be on a lighter side mostly and even says he had cast Govinda for it before LOL Shahid too excels in his role especially in the second half Bipasha is okay, Amrita too is okay Javed Sheikh does well Sushant Singh irritates
