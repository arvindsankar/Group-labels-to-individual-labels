Poorly cast, uninteresting location, amateur storytelling. This is one of those movies that crams in all the back story just as it is getting to the resolution. You can imagine the writers scrambling to think up an explanation for their ghost.Not original, unsatisfactory payoff, and some scenes with a waterfall that I guess takes takes you to a separate section of the forest that is otherwise inaccessible.I will say that the special effects surprised me, in as much as they seemed much more accomplished than any other aspect of the movie. I like B-movies, exploitation, horror, and trash, but I wasn't into this.The ghost was supposed to be Native American but looked totally Asian.The picked very uninteresting woods to film in.
