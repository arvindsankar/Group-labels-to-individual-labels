My roommate and I rented three movies and this was one of them...We should have saved it for last so that we could watch something funny before we went to bed. It was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time.What was the director thinking? This story has been done over and over and over again. And what's with the jumping around so much? It's annoying and...just plain annoying! AND they left room for sequel! WHY?I think my roommate and I are going to throw it out the window. Or maybe we'll just play Frisbee with it. I haven't decided yet. Either way, I'll get some entertainment out of it.Funniest "scary" movie ever.
