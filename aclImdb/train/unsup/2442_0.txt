Just wanted to add to the comment by Bailey-21(Alabama)...who said "the entire climax of this... is nearly an exact copy of that film (Long Kiss). Frame for frame, it's a pitiful ripoff."If you look at this scene 'Frame by frame', you can actually SEE Geena Davis standing by the truck! this is the SAME FOOTAGE!I wonder if both films were made by the same studio, and they ran out of money on this one, or if this is even legal!I felt Ripped Off!
