a movie filled with good drama, great twists and an unexpected death. Burn After Reading will make you Keep After Watching.good-a good story. a very good serious adult like comedy. amazing twists-certain characters death, the discovery of who is following George, etc.bad-first of all, i know that every film (must) introduce the characters before getting to the point of the film. but in this film, it seems like it takes forever to get to the point (the CD) and all the time up until that point seems kinda boring but at the same time entertaining.summary-a good film if you enjoy twists and are willing to accept its adult like comedic.
