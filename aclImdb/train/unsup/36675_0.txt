Always a joy too watch Lance Henriksen.Crash down, his daughter, now must the director and father(Henriksen) find his little girl.This is "based" on true events. The movie wants to be scarey, but is not.I can not remember when i watched a movie about the "abe" and got touched, or even scared. Probably never.This movie has its moments but it is quickly forgotten.
