I enjoy this film each time I watch it. I watched it twice on the Video, later I bought the DVD and have watched again a couple of times. Even though I know what is going to happen, the humor does not miss to bring laughter.Its a gradual moving comedy drama without some stupid 'sexual' comedy.One has to understand the movie in order to enjoy the funny moments. Particularly my favorites are:Marvin look.... !!! Sunglasses. Son of a bi*** stole my cigarettes again. Take a wild guess.Watch it, you will like it :)
