Totally gripping; the story weaves between ancient myths and legends and present day reality. The characters are engaging, the acting is great, and the special effects are phenomenal.I was reminded what special effects are really for - used right, they really bring a story to life, enhance it, engage your imagination and convey more than could be done any other way.This film stayed with me for days. Full of depth, wisdom, action and adventure. a must see.(I also recommend the "making of" that accompanies the movie).
