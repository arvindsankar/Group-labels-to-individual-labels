In a word? BAD. This has all the elements of a badly done "B" movie; ie: poorly developed characters, horrific cinematography, deplorable cacophonic soundtrack, and terrible over-dramatized acting. The CGI used does not even begin to redeem this detestable smack-fest of sugar-coated zombies/vampires/whatevers, the main monster looks like something an 8 year old put together for the front porch on Halloween, and the four main characters are totally indistinguishable from one another. The American version of this movie was cut, so it's possible we lost the character development on the cutting room floor, but honestly, even if we hadn't, I seriously doubt this movie would be worth watching. There is only ONE good element. The sets. The sets are nicely done, and that is literally the single enjoyable aspect of this entire production.Do yourself a favor and do something...no...do ANYthing else.It rates a 0.0/10 from...the Fiend :.
