An exercise in poor execution and poor writing, there is nothing special to this little film which has no plot, story, meaning or anything else other than toilet humor poorly executed. I do NOT recommend this movie to anyone who considers themselves as a thinking human being, its just a painful experience that has no sense, there is no way you can understand this movie, is just senseless in all ways.Bad writing, bad directing, bad acting(some not all), bad editing, bad sound effects (cartoonish unfunny).On the good part Zoe Zaldana is delicious in this, Freddy Beras is very funny, Sergio Carlo is OK, Anthony Alvarez is OK, And Koldo is very good! Also the cinematography is good, but thats about it.Its a shame the waste of money and good talent that this "Director" did, a crying shame!
