I believe the only reason anyone would have seen this film is because Russell is in it.That was my reason.Russell does well in his role.Love his hair cut in this one.A better script was needed.But, we have to keep in mind, this was not a big budget film.Helen's character Mary could GET on the audience's nerves as well, even though she was a good person & meant well.You could tell why she got on Zack's nerves.Course, she has not done much in her career. When you consider the best thing she ever did was her guest spot on "Seinfeld".By the book, not really exciting action scenes.To be seen only if you are a fan of Russell's.
