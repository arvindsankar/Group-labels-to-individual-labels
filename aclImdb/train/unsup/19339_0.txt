I actually went out of my way to find this movie because I love giant monster movies, especially King Kong related monsters.The effects in this movie were so bad they were embarrassing.It's amazing that there were better effects in 1933's King Kong compared to this...I take that back...there were better effects in 1903's The Great Train Robbery compared to this bomb.It's tough to mess up a movie with giant monsters and decent looking girls...but whoever made this movie did accomplish this feat. Anyone who is curious like I was about this film stay far away as possible. It is a total waste of your time.
