If you like Paul Verhoeven's later work (Robocop, Total Recall, Black Book), you should take the time to delve into his Dutch language work.This is a serious work showing class differences in 19th Century Holland, and the total lack of concern for workers. The title character takes a slew of meaningless jobs after the family is forced to move to the city, eventually ending up as a prostitute to survive.Hearing the typical "streets paved with gold" dreams that were typical of America at that time, we can totally relate to those driven from their farms.Women were certainly toys for men, even doctors, to play with, and rape, if they chose.It was interesting to see Rutgar Hauer in a role as a gentlemen, and the experience of Monique van de Ven was not to be missed.
