Actually, I lied: Paul Newman deserved the Oscar for "The Verdict". Anyway, Peter O'Toole gives another one of his superlative performances. How this man doesn't have an Oscar (for a performance that is) is beyond me.Then again, Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock or Martin Scorsese don't have Oscars either. As was said in the film "Comedy is hard." I believe that doing comedy must be harder than drama but for a classical actor like O'Toole--unlike American actors---comedy is an easier transition. Excellent direction by Richard Benjamin, who keeps me laughing till this day from his performance in "The Sunshine Boys" . Bill Macy was hilarious as the sycophantic writer.All in all a great film. Cheers me up every time.
