Sometimes, sometimes not.Swarms of mutant grasshoppers threaten to smother the children of *coughs* plot elements.Swarms of mutant grasshoppers blot out the sun and threaten all life on earth.All their mutant billions are miraculously killed in a few seconds by fiddling the power lines of the Midwest.It is difficult to describe the jaw-dropping awfulness of Locusts nor is there any point in attempting the job. Gotta be seen. It is the Plan 9 of the current generation and is very highly recommended.
