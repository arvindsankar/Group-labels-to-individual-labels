I watched it when it hit video stores shelves and I regret for not watching it on the theaters.By far, it was the most complex and interesting sci-fi/action packed flick from 2002.I did have my doubts towards it because Tom Cruise starred on it. You know, by the time of it's release, he got really weird.But in my opinion, this is his best performance by far. But he's not alone, he's joined by the always powerful Max Von Sydow who delivers a fantastic performance. I don't get used to watch his as a villain.The complex plot was really interesting, filled with crime, spectacular f/x, mysterious characters, and extraordinary action sequences.Every single minute caught my attention and although I can't really remember most of the specific details or sub-plots; I can say without fear of being wrong that this is a spectacular sci-fi/action flick in all the sense of the word.
