I really liked the idea for this film, of groups of people trying to survive in a dragon scorched world. It was very well executed to take this ludicrous fantasy and apply all the rules of logic etc to it.I also thought that the film looked amazing, particularly the dragons, with the effects only let down by some shoddy looking explosions at times.The only thing that let the film down was the cliched and sometimes pointless dialogue, especially from the Matthew McConaughey character.
