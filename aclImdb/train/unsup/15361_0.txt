An absolutely superb movie.The performances were believable without a doubt. Perhaps this is just coming from a male's perspective, but there is no-one in this movie you cannot relate to. Watch for similarities with "American Beauty", and, to a far lesser extent, "Cruel Intentions" and "American Pie".The cinematography is spectacular. Each scene's camera angle, lighting, et al, increase the mood tenfold. The ending is how all Hollywood movies should be. No wonder this one isn't.Issues with the amount of smoking and drinking they do, but then again, who didn't at that age? No gratuitous sex or violence, although rather large portions of both.Overall: ********/**
