I can't believe that this crap made it to dvd before the original Christy series did.The Kellie Martin series was real, the emotions real. This series is something that came straight from hell. Practically unwatchable by any fan of the original series. Avoid like the plague!!!3/10Quality: 0/10 Entertainment: 3/10 Replayable: 0/10
