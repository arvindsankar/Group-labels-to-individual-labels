As some of the others here I took the IMDb rating at 5.7 as a indicator of a OK movie, WHAT A MISTAKE.. The Alphabet Killer had no edge, no original script, the only decent actors were those in minor roles. Oh my, how I hoped that Eliza Dushku would just die or go insane and be gone. Never have there been a worse actress in this kind of leading role, especially not in a movie that was rated 5.7/10 on IMDb.Someone must have cheated with the rating of this movie and the IMDb staff should take actions against such..I was neutral when I started watching this movie, nothing against Eliza Dushku or any of the other actors, but this movie killed all the future Eliza Dushku movies.. I will never watch another Eliza Dushku movie in my life, except if she is an extra and dies in like 4 seconds..
