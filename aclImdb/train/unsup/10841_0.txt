The game is great, the story is great with twists i would never had expected had my friend not spoiled it for me.The creative puzzles will have you confused to the max and the level design is surprisingly small but thanks to the portal technology and wall walks levels seem surprisingly bigger then they actually are.The thing that surprised me the most was the long lasting storyline that kept going even when you thought i would end but a small downside is the Multiplayer.The MP is good the weapons and maps are good it's just the fact that the amount of people playing is small and if someone lags everyone else does.The Single player has a long lasting and lively story as well as inventive puzzles.Nowadays you can pick it up cheap, i got my copy brand new for Â£20. I Say definitely rent it at least.Graphics: 8 The graphics are good but some areas are a bit too shiny for me.Sound: 9.5 The sounds are pretty good and the voice acting is great.Story: 10 Play it yourself, you'll understand.Weaponry: 6 There aren't many weapons but they're cool.MP: 6.5 Could be better
