I was startled by how poor this film was.All the male characters that were supposed to be "cool" laughably sported identical black leather jackets and stubble, looking every bit like middle class drop outs, but getting their kicks from hanging around illegal bare knuckle fights... the scenes in which the naughty posh boys were knocking about with psychotic hard-men bottling each other in a strip bar were extremely cringe-worthy and utterly unbelievable.Also did anyone notice how much Marc Warren looked like Eddie Izzard in the orgy scene with that diamant√© dog collar?! That chuckle was the only thing I enjoyed about the whole film.Oh - the kid was an excellent actor too - really good.Other than that it was RUBBISH!
