wow.. this movie was sooooooo interesting.. zzzzz.. (falls on the floor sleeping) with the well known actors... ehh.. tom hardy who has played a minor role in black hawk down! Michelle Van Der Water who has like played in three movies! ooOOo.. the rest of the cast has either played 1-3 movies.the story was very weak.. yey 8 people running around in a maze who is hunted by a "Minotaur". even i could have written better.. the actors must have been the dumbest ever!! " ooOoo maybe if i scream every time, even if the monster are not after me, someone will rescue me.. opps i drew the monsters attention.. i wonder why.. let me scream a little more, maybe ill scare it away!".. damn jerks..many goofs! omg.. such as (spoiler) when one is trying to climb up from the maze, you can clearly see he is hanging by a large string..everyone is going to disagree that i GAVE IT A two! but all the others only say the same (not kidding) "Surprisingly better than most Sci-Fi originals" something around that.. anyway i only gave this movie a two, because the minotaur wasn't so bad made and it was sooo cute...
