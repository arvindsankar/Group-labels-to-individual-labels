Well you all should know the plot line by now, from the other comments.I decided to pick this one up to see if it held up over the years, since I hadn't seen it since the theatrical. Wow 27 years. And I have to say, I laughed just as hard as I did back then. This movie is well worth looking at again. The quotes go on and on. I still say "That Barney Rubble,..what an actor".And when Michael Keaton is driving and flipping off the cops, come on, what is not to love.Everyone is great in this movie, Winkler, Keaton, Long, Belzer, when I was young I dreamed Shelly Long would make me eggs.I could go on and on.Comedies today should take note of the brash classics of the early eighties.Also just look at 42nd street before Disney took over.
