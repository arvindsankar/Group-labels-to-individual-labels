I really think it's funny when someone writes "I serious it Retarded of a cartoon." Wha? This person cannot even write a simple sentence, yet they feel they can bash a show that is obviously superior to their own banal excuse for intellect - and I don't even know what that means.Apparently they are not "Responsible" or "Dependable" or "Reliable" or "Not an Idiot". And what about CN being 90% cartoons? Umm. CN = Cartoon Network. Hmmm.Maybe I have misjudged this person and really they are a comedic genius that deserves to be revered as sublime. The Monkey Show Rules whether or not you are smart enough to know it.
