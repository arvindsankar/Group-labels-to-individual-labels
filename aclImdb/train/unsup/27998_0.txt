This film was terrible. Really really bad.i just read a comment saying that you'll be enriched. if anyone ever says this about a film like this it means that you have to watch a slow boring film which is absolute drivel.Its about a Scottish guy - very unlikeable - in fact its not really about anything - its an absolute snooze.If you think of yourself as a film critic you could analyze it and say oh yes its wonderful but this film was terrible. Its just pointless, not about anything - just some boring mean Scottish guy who attempts to kill himself. Great! I mean watch a good film not some arty crap.And - enriched! I mean i cant remember much of this film because i saw it a while ago and its totally unmemorable but i think he meets a girl and decides to put off killing himself for a bit.i don't know about you but that didn't make me jump up and say OK I'm gonna grab life by the balls , what an inspiring film! its just a boring load of crap. absolute drivel.1 out of 10.
