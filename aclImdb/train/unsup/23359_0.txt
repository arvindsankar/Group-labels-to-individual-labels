This movie wins the 8th edition of the "Udine FarEastFilm Festival". I saw it in this occasion. The music by Joe Hisaishi has made me dream. The director says he was inspired by two Italian movies:"Mediterraneo" directed by Gabriele Salvatores because both of them talks about war and soldiers who lives in peace; "La vita Ã¨ bella" (Life is Beautiful) directed by Roberto Benigni in fact both of them introduce some people's sacrifice to save the innocent ones.I think it's beautiful, and I recommend to whoever to see it. Life would be more beautiful if the war didn't exist.
