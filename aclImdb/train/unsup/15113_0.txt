The Long Good Friday, with Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren introduces us to characters I won't soon forget. Hoskins, as Harold Shand, a London crime boss, is a standout performer. Having never even heard of this movie until I ran across it on cable, I was truly impressed with Mr Hoskins' acting chops. The rest of the cast is truly excellent also from Helen Mirren's performance as Shand'sbusiness-like wife, to PH Moriarty's role as one hell of an enforcer aptlynicknamed "razors", this movie really does send a chill down your spine. Thecasual violence inflicted by the main characters is never gratuitous, asevidenced by the scene where Shand's competitors are hung like sides of beeffor questioning. In this case, less is more. The ending is truly a classic. Im thinking about it now and I still feel my stomach drop when I imagine myself in Shand's shoes. An excellent addition to any DVD collection, I'm very happy to have stumbled across this gem. Highly Recommended.
