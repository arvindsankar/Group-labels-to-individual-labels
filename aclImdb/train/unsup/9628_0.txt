This 2006 film played in no more than 4 theatres in late 2006.It should have played in at least 1000 theatres across the country. The R rating it has gotten is incorrect,It really should be a PG 13.The F word is used a few times as an expression & there is one nasty sexual remark one teen ager makes to his buddy. THIS TO ME IS NO REASON FOR THE R RATING,.James Ponsoldt both wrote the screenplay & directed with much care.Nick Nolte one of our better actors gives the performance of his career as sick heavy drinking man, who has many problems.Trevor Morgan was not yet 20 when he did this film,he too is a troubled teen who is befriended by Nick Nolte after he does a bit of vandalism to Nolte's house. Young Mr Morgan will be an actor to watch for many years, This is not his first film BUT the reason is obvious why he got this plum role/ HE WILL BE A STAR.Timothy Hutton is Trevor's very silent & distant father. & is just excellent.Rosemarie Dewitt is charming as Trevors younger sister.In fact the entire cast is excellent,.HOWEVER PLEASE NOTE the film is slow moving, Please see this & stay with it,you will be rewarded & at the very end find out what the title meansRatings ***1/2 (out of 4) 93 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (OUT OF 10)
