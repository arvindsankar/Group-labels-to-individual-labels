We threw out the Television and broke its picture tube in the middle of this film.I'm not kidding.In my life I have only been fully repulsed by the theme, story, acting and directing of a movie a couple of times. Orca, the Killer Whale comes to mind....Not just bad, but disgusting and disturbing. The mixture of sexual violence and mayhem/murder, a combination I have reported on before, is below any line any film-goer can draw. Coprophagia and cannibalism are all that's left to sink to, and there's no bottom to hit.
