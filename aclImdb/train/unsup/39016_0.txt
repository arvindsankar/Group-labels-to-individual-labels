What are they thinking about when they make drivel like this. No plot, just melodrama, same stereotypes and same typecast actors in same crap no plot movie.Abhishek doesn't belong in a role opposite Ash, he is better placed behind a terminal at Wipro Infotech.On top of that who is that gay dude who comes as Vik to marry Ash and take her money. He is the son of Bhushan from Buiniyaad , yet another historical typecast fellow.The only thong missing was Alok Nath as a a overemotional uncle of Ash....Aamir Khan
