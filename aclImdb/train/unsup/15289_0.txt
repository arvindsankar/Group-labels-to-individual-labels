Yes, indeed, the acting is abominable and some of the characters are corny, and some of the takes take the speed out of the proceedings.... yes, this is all true, BUT:The handful of clues (hopefully not RED herrings) strewn throughout the movie gave me the hope that this one - at last - would be the dreamed SciFi movie to top all other movies in the field of such intriguing questions as: "Where does mankind come from?" And WHY? "are there others out there in the vast universe?" "Do we - both individually and as mankind - have a mission to complete, and - if so - what is it?" "will all questions mankind ever had be answered someday?"I would like to know more about Ice Planet and of course I have a burning question: "will this movie ever be followed up by a complete series?" If anyone knows more about it, please, answer.
