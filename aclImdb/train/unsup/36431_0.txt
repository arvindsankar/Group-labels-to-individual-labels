This piece of trash is totally without merit. There are many inaccuracies about The Maid. I have extensive knowledge of her life, and this movie must be about someone else. On the DVD, Milla Jovovich has the gall to say that the producers uncovered so much information about The Maid, that I am prompted to ask: "Then, why didn't your husband use it?" (She was married to Luc Besson during filming.)Joan's sister was neither raped nor murdered by any raiders.There is no history of Joan breaking into a church and drinking wine.Joan was close to her parents, and left them, sadly, when she went to Vaucoleurs (sic).Joan never killed anyone, nor tried to. "The Conscience" is a creation of Luc Besson; no evidence that such a personality ever talked with Joan.If you want to know more of the truth about Joan, read the book by Regine Pernoud, or even the movie "Jeanne la Pucelle", starring Sandrine Bonnaire, is adequate.
