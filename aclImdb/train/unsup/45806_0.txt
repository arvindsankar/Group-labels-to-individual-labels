there is NOTHING about this movie, absolutely nothing, worth watching NOTHINGif you liked the movie, if you liked the series, do yourself a HUGE favor, do NOT WATCH this1) the music is terrible (cheap at best) 2) the writing is so amazingly bad 3) talking heads, rather than acting 4) stilted acting, wooden heads reading lines from cue cards 5) worthless directing 6) INANE dialog 7) the ending? insipid 8) special effects? why bother, NOTHING could save this movie 9) sword fighting? nope, people banging sticks togetherI really don't understand why anyone spent any money on this. I can't understand why the scifi channel broadcast this.
