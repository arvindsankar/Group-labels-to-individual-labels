i put his movie into the queue. i was really looking forward to it since it got votes. Sadly,like all Spanish, Hispanic, Latin stuff, this movie is overly dramatic and overblown.just look at aldomavar movies like "tak to her"every emotion is jetted like an a-bomb. it is similar to "I have a hangnail, so i will rip off my fingers".the love affairs cause grand Mal seizures in the lovers. type of reaction to situations. so if you go in for cornball over the top emotional hooey.this is your movie. interesting topic poorly written and acted.
