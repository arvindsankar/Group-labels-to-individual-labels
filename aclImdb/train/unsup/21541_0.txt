Disclosure #1: I saw the first ten minutes and was so bored, I just FF'd through the rest.Disclosure #2: I worked on this film. It was a horrible horrible experience since the director was a huge, freakin' idiot who didn't know what he wanted or even how to get it in the instance that he did know what he was aiming for. It was the biggest fluster cluck I've ever been a witness to.Disclosure #3: I am neither black nor a hip-hop/rap fan so I'm not exactly in the demo that this movie was aimed at.That all said, this wasn't the worst film, Urban or otherwise, that I've ever seen. Bottomline, it's competently put together and I woudn't go much farther. It's not good enough to sit down and watch, nor is it bad enough to sit down and mock; it just sits there totally inert and lifeless. It just is.Meh.
