I have seen this film and was expecting something quite good, but its the worst film I have seen in a long time, the acting is atrocious and wooden.It seems as if the film was made just for showing gore and forgetting the acting bit.Basically the storyline would have been good if they had picked decent actors and actresses, bringing it as an up to date story of Frankenstein.The blood and gore were over emphasised and didn't look real. Just a complete waste of time and money.
