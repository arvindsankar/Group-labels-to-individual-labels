I am sorry, but it is a SIN that this film is not getting more recognition. It literally is one of the greatest movies about the art of dance EVER MADE. I mean, people, this is an awesome film about the ART of movement in its rawest most creative stage and there has never been a film like it.Please don't miss it.And also don't miss the Ab soundtrack CD.The use of music in the film is truly exceptional and not overwhelming.The documentary style is clever (even if it is a little hazy on detail and maybe stretches a few truths).And finally, please bring some children to see this so they can see the "other side".Secret political message of the film: why are we spending money in IRAQ when there is so much need here?
