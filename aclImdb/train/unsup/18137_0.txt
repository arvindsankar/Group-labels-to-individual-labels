I watched this movie at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, and enjoyed it.However, I've been trying to work something out. What did the people who were trying to bribe Muharrem want from him? Did they want the Order to give them construction contracts?Did they just want to get in his good books because he was a influential man in the community?If anyone who has watched this has any idea, please post.The director was present at the screening, and he was asked this question in the Q&A after the movie. He didn't really understand the question, I think it was lost in translation, as he only spoke Turkish. Thanks.
