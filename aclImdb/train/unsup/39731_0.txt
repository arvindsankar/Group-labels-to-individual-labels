What a crappy movie. Can't understand how Meg Ryan accepted to participate on it.Haven't seen Meg Ryan and Antonio Banderas in good movies for the past...4 years I think.Fell asleep 15 minutes after it started. I thought it was going to be funny, a good comedy but it turned out to be excessively dumb. No plot, no script, no sense.By the way Meg Ryan's makeover went really bad. That angel face is gone, her face is so inexpressive now. The botox doesn't allow her to move her lips anymore. How sad.Avoid this movie at all cost, it's an awful waste of money and time.
