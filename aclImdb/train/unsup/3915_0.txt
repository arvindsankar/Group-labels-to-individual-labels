A friend and myself were watching the rented tape. After starting the tape and watching the trailers of several movies. We thought, "what a long and confusing trailer this is". It took us about 15 minutes before we realized we weren't watching the trailer. The movie already started!After that, it only got better. A very nice confusing and hilarious movie. Great characters. Great dialog. Great stupid story.See it.Summary We were smoking a lot of home grown herbs at the moment. But that didn't affect our judgment at all!
