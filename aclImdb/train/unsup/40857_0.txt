This film is kind of like loads of other films but in one.They had no good idea so they decide to try and make other good films funny but failing.I watched about 30 minutes of this film and then turned it off. Was the worst film and attempt of a comedy I've ever seen.I don't recommend this film. A lame cast too.It's similar to Scary Movie. Lots of films in one, but it's not as funny, not as good cast, it's pathetic and rubbish. It should be a crime for it to be called "Epic Movie" as it the opposite of the title.If you want to waste 80 minutes of your life, you could at least find a better film. This film isn't even worth the rental.
