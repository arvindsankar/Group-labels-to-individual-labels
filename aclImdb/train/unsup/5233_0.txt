When I was only six, my mother and father sent my older brother totake me to watch the Olson and Johnson routine at a New YorkCity nightclub called THE CARNIVAL. I had been aware of theantics of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy and Abbott andCostello, but now I could see first hand the live slapstick ofinvolved comedy.The film "Crazy House" is a perfect example of keeping the wild artof updated slapstick alive on film. It is an update of the piethrowing of early silents and the progression from Charlie Chaplinto Charlie Chase. This film even has small roles for all the lesserknown comics of that era. Their roles in this movie are much thesame as the bit inserts into "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World".For those a little bit younger than myself, this film would be calledthe progenitor of "Rowan & Martin's Laugh In", a TV series that ranfrom 1968-1973.All I can say is, "If you want to see the visualization of one liners aspresented in the 1940's try and get to see this film". In the shortwhile, watch "Laugh In" reruns and prep yourself for a look backinto comedy history.
