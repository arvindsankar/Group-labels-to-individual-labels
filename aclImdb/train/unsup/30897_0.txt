This is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but its very bad, people track down a weird radio broadcast of someone yelling for help to an old house, there is a little girl with a doll that plays bad music in what I am guessing is an attempt to annoy people to death.People die, badly, then the little girls grave is burned....the end.Oh yeah, I forgot, at the end one of the characters says "She was just a normal little girl till her dad got her that doll."WHAT? How could this guy possibly know this?Awful.
