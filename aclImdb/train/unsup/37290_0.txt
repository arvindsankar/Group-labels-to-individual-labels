The main problem with this film is more fundamental. Laura is essentially a very tragic character, not a comical one.The story is a tragedy, but it seems that the director himself has missed that point. Ludomania, which is the film's underlying theme, is not funny, but pathetic and tragic.Instead, the director attempts to dress up the story and present it as a hybrid of a comedy and a "love story" between an alcoholic and a compulsive gambler. It just doesn't work.The ending is also a complete letdown: Laura informs Claus that she has decided to sort out herself and work on her (very serious) problems. She states that their relationship cannot continue.This could have been a decent ending, leaving on a hopeful note, but it is completely ruined during the end credits where a number of idiotic sketches show that Laura and Claus have moved together anyway -- with Laura constantly betting with Claus over ridiculous things.Give it a miss. 2 out of 5 stars (** of *****).
