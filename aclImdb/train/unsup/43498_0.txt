This is one of the few films I have EVER seen, I would call TOTAL RUBBISH!It is a shame to see a talent like Nigel Benett, wasted in such trash.It truly has NO redeeming qualities,The screenplay is completely incoherent, to the point one has to only imagine the editor, had some kind of brain aneurysm, whilst working on it.Somewhere after what may, or may not be, the second act, there is a 20 minute motorbike, "chase", that simply serves no purpose, other than to show off some "special effects" and explosions, and even they are so cheap, it is embarrassing to watch.I have no idea, how you even get finance, let alone insurance to make such a film.This film makes Plan9 from Outer Space look like Lord of the Rings! At least Plan9, had ambition, beyond its years, or finance.Life is too short, >AVOIDAVOIDAVOIDAVOID
