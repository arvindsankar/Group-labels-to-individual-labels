With a forgettable plot, painful dialog and non-existent directing, this is a waste of film.The first story "fiction" is by far the worst of the two. Dialog is delivered with pauses after nearly every line as if they just spoke some profound words that will be remembered for the ages. All it really shows is the director's lack of purpose. It's as if he's trying to be avant-guard or biting but all he ends up doing is looking ridiculous.The second story "non-fiction" is not as painful but still is a joke. None of the characters are even remotely believable and just come across as poor imitations of clich√©'s that aren't valid anymore. If this was a first time director then I would expect this type of result....but it isn't. All it shows is the director's shot at trying to recapture his initial creative success and missing.....badly.
