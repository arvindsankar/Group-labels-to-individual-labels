I investigated this a possible movie to show to my Latin students about a strong female hero. Unfortunately, it proved completely unsuitable.Disturbing battle violence, a scene of full frontal male nudity, a very graphic and prolonged gang rape scene with thrusting and screaming, and an unnecessary sex scene between Boudica and her lover after battle.I didn't even get to the part where Nero has graphic sexual activity with his mother.No educational value, no entertainment value.Avoid for students at all costs!Even lovers of Alex Kingston will be disappointed.
