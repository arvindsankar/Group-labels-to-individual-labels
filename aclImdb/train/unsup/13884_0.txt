Can anybody tell me what happened with Jody Ann Shaffell's case (or the true life story that this was based on anyway)? I think that the US should just grow up!! (No offense meant to the sane people living there).Children are raised in worse situations than that poor boy and the courts do nothing!! How about some compassion?!?! I'd like to know, for my own peace of mind, that the boy has found his way to his mother.Any feedback would be nice.I would like to think that these people came to their senses.
