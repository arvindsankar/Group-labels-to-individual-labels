The story may be 50 years old but this revised version,shown live in 2005, was every bit is tense and thrilling as the original.Great performances by David Tennant,Adrian Dunbar,Andy Tiernan and Jason Flemyng were overshadowed by the acting of Indira Verma and Mark Gatiss who stole the show.The lack of CGI and any real special effects will probably seem strange to the modern audience who like monsters and gore but I found it a treat to be able to use my imagination which was stoked up by the performances.The ending may also disappoint in this regard. However given the premise that Quatermass is appealing to the "Humanity" of the victims I think it works very well on an abstract level and has a creepy feel all of its own.The DVD version uses two clips taken from the recording of the final run through and allows for the smooth running of a couple of shots that, on the night, didn't go to plan! This is a pity as it gives the over all production too much polish and loses some of its "as live" appeal.No matter - maybe the programme will be repeated as was in the future (Or the cut scenes will appear as extras somewhere - they are not on the DVD unfortunately!).There is an easter egg on the video if you search for it - and is of great interest to Doctor Who fans!
