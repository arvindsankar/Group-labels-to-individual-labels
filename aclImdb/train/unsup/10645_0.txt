This is an often overlooked gem in Coppola's filmography. It was critically blasted when it was originally released because of the "high" cost at the time. The reviews at that time seemed to center more on how much Francis spent than on the movie and it's visual style.It's a classic/simple story of a couple who have lost the spice in their relationship, who break up, seek other people and then discover that, perhaps, what they had was better after all.Frederic Forrest and Teri Garr give excellent performances as the bored couple. Frederic Forrest in particular does a great job giving the audience the sense of a regular guy who thinks that something exotic is what he really needs. He's also gives a great emotional baring when he realizes that he may have lost what he had.Nice performances by Nastassja Kinski and Raul Julia (at his charming fast-talking energetic best) as the "others", whose arms the main characters fall into.The visual style is very audacious. It is very theatrical, with the most famous instance being the recreation of a Las Vegas strip street corner, built on a sound stage for the big dance number. The clever use of theatrical effects (like lighting crossfades through scrim to change from one scene/room to another) really gives this film a magical unreal feel. I might call it "magical" reality, a lot of attention to detail but not truly realistic. Americans seem very fixated on film being "realistic", which may have contributed to the lukewarm reception this film received.FABULOUS soundtrack by the wonderful gravelly Tom Waits, partnered with the clear sweetness of Crystal Gayle's lovely voice.Coppola on his WORST day (which some consider this film) is better than most directors on their BEST day.Gil-Bob says: "Check it out!"
