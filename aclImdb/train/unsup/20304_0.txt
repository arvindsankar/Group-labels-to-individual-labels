I've been a fan of BOTTOM and YOUNG ONES for years, since I was 11 to be exact (Im 20 now!!) and I hadnt seen nothing until I saw the BOTTOM LIVE videos!!!!Okay the second one was a wee bit iffy for me but still I loved it!! The parrot was funny especially when everyone applauded and Ade says "Thats right give the lump of plastic an applause!!".The way they improvise when something goes wrong (missing lines- Rik's speciality, tripping over wires, doors flying open) is PURE CLASSIC! The improvisation bits always crack me up, leaving me in utter stitches!!!Go.....see.......now!!!H xxxxx
