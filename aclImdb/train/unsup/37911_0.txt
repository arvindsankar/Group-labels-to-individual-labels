Just when you think Affleck can't get any worse, he, and his movie choices do just that...reliably so.It is hard to believe that someone with an academy award for screen writing (undeserved, boogie nights deserved it)can't select even a halfway decent script when it arrives for him. Or maybe people simply aren't sending him any good scripts because they have realized he cannot act.Regardless, I cannot in good conscience give a full review of this film, since it was so horrid that i turned it off 40 minutes in to watch Meerkat Manor...because it has better acting and a better story.chalk up another disaster for Affleck, a man who has dropped more bombs than the air force.I really do not know what else to say...avoid it if you can...the theaters sure did.
