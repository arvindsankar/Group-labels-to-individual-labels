blah....sorry but I can't jump on the Billy Crystal Bandwagon and telleveryone how great this movie was, because it wasn't really thatgood.Please someone find actors who can throw baseballs...I am sickand tired of watching these types of baseball movies. At leastwhen Kevin Costner throws a baseball he looks like a ball player.But oh well maybe my expectations were too high from seeing allthese great reviews.City Slickers 3* anyone...anyone...anyone?
