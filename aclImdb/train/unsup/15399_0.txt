What else would you give your own personal story...This film is probably a coincidence but 9 out of the 10 things that happened in this movie are about me...I attended Avon Old Farms (Where the movie was filmed)I played Hockey there (The lead actor Plays Hockey)The 2nd weekend there I got caught with a girl off campus and was about to get kicked out when...(Don't want to spoil the ending)The Boardroom scene was verbatim.The Teachers were identical.The only thing they left out was my name....I'm very interested in meeting the writer considering the DVD says based on a true story...Yours Truly,The Legend of Avon Old Farms...Todd JohnsonP.S. Looks like getting kicked out of AOF 22 years ago was finally worth it.
