Pretty decent heist flick benefits from better than average perfs from Shaw and Shaft.Golan decides to film it all in the Holy Land which, if nothing else, gives it some excellent cinematography to work in front of.Shaw shows that he could have been James Bond. He looked great in the role. One almost wonders why the Oscars didn't call on him more often.Shaft Roundtree made an excellent balance for him too. He did the hired muscle routine with a touch of class.I'm trying to figure out Shelly Winters role though. It seemed like the producers just wanted to hire her just to hire her. Don't get me wrong. She did fine in the part. But why was it there? Dated a lot. But still a thrill ride.
