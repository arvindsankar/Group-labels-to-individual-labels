this film isn't going to change your life. it's fun and camp in a butch kinda was. these guys can act and they look good too.the plot is simple and that is it's greatest flaw. there is almost a porn feel to it (or it could be that i've seen too much porn) and i'm getting confused.I wouldn't sell this an seminal gay movie but it's good to see something which is like a mainstream movie in which instead of a girl in a bra running away from the killer you get to see a cute guy scream and run away like a girl, *smile*. I actually seem this with a room full of straight men (well the vast majority) and it got a round of applause.keep 'em coming.......
