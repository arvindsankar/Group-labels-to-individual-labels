Think about this sentence next time you watch it this shitty movie you'll lol forever.Enough with the god damn babies and unsubtle and shameless appeal to emotion. It's disgusting.First time it starts off as hatred for the terrorists.Second time it's disapproval of the direction style. Third time it's hatred for writers and directors. Fourth time you end up hating Hollywood.By the 15th time you've already signed up for al qaeda and your on your way to a flag burning.I really have nothing more to say but I'm going to type this because IMDb has this weird 10 line minimum so here goes.Religion {all major ones) have caused the large large majority of wars and hatred thought history.Christianity, Islam, Judaism are the most destructive organization of people in the history of man kind.
