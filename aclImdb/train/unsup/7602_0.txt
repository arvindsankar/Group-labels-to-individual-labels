I have recently married the most gorgeous man ever. I have corrupted him by encouraging him to drink absinthe and fall in love with jean Arthur and Norma shearer.one of his favourite seduction was the Robert Montgomery- Norma shearer "private lives" but tonight...but tonight we shared our very own discovery. the Lubitch masterpiece 'DESIGN FOR LIVING'I had never seen it, but I know that there is no coward only Hetch, but who cares?it is a wonderful film with wondrous performances and a classic in so many ways.Brian
