I decided to write this review because I felt it's unfair for the movie from the negative comments and ratings it had.First off, as other commenters said, this is a romantic comedy movie, I think this movie served this concept in a very well manner.The idea is new, nicely presented, well written and directed. It comes to many young men, or middle age men to be like the main character in the movie (Conner meed) Matthew McConaughey, to have many womens around, having only FUN with them, be successful and so on. and that is for sure what the new generation dreams of!, However this movie shows the consequences of such a life in a funny, simple and well presented way. It shows how important to have a constant partner with committed and respectful relationship, not only touch and go!I like the story plot, the scenario and even the visual effects are really good and serves the movie.Good work for all characters in the movie and the directing was very very good.
