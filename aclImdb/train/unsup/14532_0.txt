Given the meager quality of a good part of the third season, that's what this feels like.I can live with a dimension-crossing paranoid maniac. I can live with him being a threat to the immediate area, several solar systems, maybe even the galaxy.But the universe?I don't even want to talk about the basic flaws in the whole matter-antimatter plot point, but 150-200 lbs of matter and antimatter wouldn't take out the universe.The dilithium bit I can live with. They were still getting their feet wet on the technology, deciding what exactly this and that could and couldn't do. I just grind my teeth a little during those scenes.The thing I just absolutely can't buy is the solution. Toss Laz A in with Laz B and let them duke it out for eternity?The ship has phasers. Take out his ship. No ship, no doorway. And if you're afraid he might build another one, you have two choices.#1 - Lock him up for the rest of his natural life, doped out on thorazine to the gills. #2 - You've got a phaser in your hand, he doesn't, and what happens on Planet Vegas stays on Planet Vegas.Still, though, not as bad as Spock's Brain. Or Wink of an Eye. Or Spectre of the Gun. Or.... well, you get the idea.
