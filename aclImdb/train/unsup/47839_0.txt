It was a nightmare but a comedy film. Mehmet Ali Erbil continued his mission to destroy Turkish cinema and he is very successful.First of all the script is not original. It is copied from Cem Yılmaz's stand up shows. None of the artists done their job, they were awful. Cüneyt Arkın, made himself disgraced. This movie was a shame for Turkish cinema and should not be watched. Whatever you do in 110 minutes, would be more useful than you spend to watch this piece of trash. The director (Kartal Tibet) should not feel comfortable after this movie. Nobody can erase these awful scenes from my mind. I gave one point for this movie because there was no zero.I hope Mehmet Ali Erbil would not act on a film again.
