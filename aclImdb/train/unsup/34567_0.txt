For all the love I have for South Park, I must say this movie is horrible without even the redeeming factor of being horribly horrible. It just sucks! And no pun intended.Juvenile, concocted (again no pun intended), poorly written, amateuristic direction and very predictable.From the get go I felt no empathy whatsoever with our mormon idiot. Halfway through I was wondering why I was still watching this. And by the end I was wishing for my life back.Even now I waste time writing this review, hoping to save some of you from this colossal waste of time.
