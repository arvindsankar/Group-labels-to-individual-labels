This is a delightful film about a Southern belle, Grace King Bichon(Julia Roberts), who chafes under the domination of herbrook-no-dissent father, and is cheated on by her husband. Graceworks for her father on his horse farm, and her suppressedresentment of his iron rule has likely helped derail her marriage toEddie. In any event, the film is ultimately about the love andstrength of family relationships and the power of forgiveness, aswell as finding one's own path in life. All actors turn in greatperformances: Julia Roberts as the heroine and wronged wife;Robert Duvall as the family patriarch; Gena Rowlands as thebeautiful and devoted spouse and mother; and Kyra Sedgwick asthe transgressive sister. Dennis Quaid as Grace's philanderinghusband is very appealing, so it's hard not to be rooting for he andGrace to reconcile. Finally, good cinematography and a portrait ofgracious Southern living make this film an enjoyable view.
