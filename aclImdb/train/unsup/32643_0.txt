This is not a great film, and certainly not a worthy sequel to the hysterical first film.The lack of any other characters from the first is a killing blow to this film.Its worth a look for the dog "ballsack" and for Taj. But otherwise its little more than giggle-worthy. Also, there is an incredible lack of research into real English society, This is the weakest Lampoon film i have ever seen.But worth a look when you're freeNeeded Ryan Reynolds.
