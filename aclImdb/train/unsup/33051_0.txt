Not a pleasant film. Definitely a male bashing film.There is little to like about Thelma and Louise. They hate their lives and instead of doing something to improve them, they take off on a road trip that soon turns into a running nightmare including murder, armed robbery, attacking a cop and blowing up a fuel truck.The saddest moment is when that beautiful T-Bird goes sailing off into oblivion. What a waste of such a beautiful car. Of course, the women are in the car at the time and their road trip ends in their untimely death.They could have found better lives with a different approach.Of course, that kind of message movie would have been a lot harder to write and probably drawn a smaller audience.Instead we got the violence and hopelessness that is Thelma & Louise.I only decided to finally watch this movie because Geena Davis is so good at playing the U.S. President in the ABC network TV drama "Commander in Chief".Now I wish I had not seen this film. It will be hard to disassociate her from the miserable character she portrays in T&L.
