Definitely a Saturday night trash movie!A serial killer is knocking off female law students and photographing their bodies as he is a photographer professionally.The beautiful lawyer tries to track him down, the trial is an interesting farce and although the twist was predictable it was reasonably well done.The lawyer's former law school room-mate was a victim, and the victim's father keeps on cropping up with pieces of advice and wisdom ... "You have to trust the system".Perhaps he can be Yoda in the next Star Wars film.
