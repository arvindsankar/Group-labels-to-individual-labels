With the exception of viewing the lovely Ingrid Goude (I believe she was a 'Miss Universe'), this movie is a bore. 'Killer Shrews' are actually dogs with fake fangs put on them, as far as I can tell.Although the shrews are at times humorous, I find this film quite a snore. And sadly, it's done just a little too well to be an entertaining 'bad' film.So it lingers in that limbo of movies that is ultimately forgettable.I only have it in my collection, as I remember it from my childhood of watching various bad b horror movies on TV. I think Sir Graves Ghastly used to show this from time to time.Not good and not horribly bad, this movie is strictly 'dullsville'.
