This epic and beautifully shot western is one of Costner's best films.Following the life of legendary law man Wyatt Earp, this very underrated movie pictures the 'real' man with the 'legend' and gives viewers' a chance to decide for themselves what type of man Earp really was. Costner's performance as the law man is superb. Through the innocence of youth to a moody old man, he fits the role perfectly and proves he is better than Kurt Russell's Earp in 'Tombstone'. The shoot-outs are superb and there is fantastic support from Dennis Quaid as the ill Doc Holliday, as well as Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore and Bill Pullman. Although a tad long and the the fact that there seems to be no dirt anywhere in this film, I urge you to check this out.8 out of 10
