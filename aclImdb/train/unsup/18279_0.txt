I suppose I'm somewhat biased, but, as someone who worked on the show during it's first season, I found it to be an absolutely abysmal experience.The DOP, while being a pompous ass, managed to turn out something that looked grainy and amateurish. If his talent could only have equaled his impression of himself it might have looked like something decent.Chris, playing "himself" (whatever) and producer, had little tolerance for your normal technical requests other than "find your light".The rest of the cast were quite pleasant to work with.Could have been a good show if the producers had listened to concerns expressed.... or had found something funny to shoot.I always refer to it as a "comedy". Like an updated version of the Monkees, but shot for cable with cursing and without the flying around high speed on wires... and without being funny.You only have so much lamp life on your TV. Save it for something good.
