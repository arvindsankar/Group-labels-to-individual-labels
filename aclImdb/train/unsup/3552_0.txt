This movie made me question my own sincerity of faith.One can only pray that the Lord will provide special graces to anyone who ever faces that level of persecution. In, and of myself, I would never be able to withstand such mistreatment.I look at how coddled and spoiled I am socially as a professing Christian in the USA, and have to really wonder how much I would truly be able to withstand under such harsh situations.I have heard Nora Lam's testimony, and I can hardly imagine what it would be like to have to stand firm under any "real" persecution.Just to think that such things even still go on today around the world, is a painful reality.
