I went into the cinema with expectations of a Mugahal-e-Azam kind of movie. It turned out to be equivalent of "Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag" instead.The script is mediocre. Plot is shallow.Message to be conveyed is not clear. The pace of the narration is uneven.In short if you have time and money to be spent on nothing better, go and watch it. Otherwise stay away.The editing, screenplay, music and direction leave a lot on the table.Performances are mediocre at best.It is full of historical inaccuracies.
