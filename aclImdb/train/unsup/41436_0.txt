I first saw Brandy & Mr. Whiskers on the Disney channel and decided to watch it. While I do like Charles Adler's voice acting, this show don't really make me laugh. I really didn't find it funny. I found Dave the Barbarian to be funnier.SPOILERS!!! For those who don't know anything about this show, it's about two animals who get stranded in the Amazon Jungle. A snotty and pampered pooch named Brandy and a brain dead rabbit named Mr. Whiskers who wears an orange jail outfit or so that's what it looks like.The first episode showed them falling into the jungle, meeting Loa-Boa, a snake who is purple and pink and wears earrings. She saves them in the first episode towards the end.The show is mildly enjoyable, but don't have the charm as some old school shows like Nick's Nicktoons per say Rocko, Angry Beavers and the Ren and Stimpy Show.The only thing I found kind of funny was when they cue to real photos in the show.I rate this show 3 out of 5 claw prints
