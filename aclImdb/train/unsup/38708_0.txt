Lucky guy, this Eric Brown. First, he gets de-flowered by Sylvia Kristel (Emmannuelle herself) in "Private Lessons", and then is floored by the charms of Sybil Danning in this movie. Talk about being born under a lucky sign.Observant people will tell you that only Danning's scenes give this flick any merit. And they're right: as predatory as ever, Danning exudes sex and sensuality as a college professor (only in Hollywood) who tricks student Brown into killing a relative so she and he can run off with her inheritance. Of course, someone else is knocking off everybody left and right....I'm sorry, you care about the plot? Well, don't. This is not a plot-driven story, as if you haven't figured that out already. If you can't figure out who is doing the killing, get a new hobby. Or better yet, just concentrate on Sybil. Maybe even think about how lucky that Eric Brown guy is.One star. Anyone who is a Sybil Danning fan will tell you: fast-forward through everything else but her in "They're Playing with Fire". Otherwise, you'll get burned.
