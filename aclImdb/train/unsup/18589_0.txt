This movie claims to be like "Blair Witch Project" (which is not that good of a movie itself) so when I saw it on the shelf I just laughed.But something told me to rent it (must be the devil himself).Now, some classic "b" movies are so bad that they are actually kinda good, but this movie is just so bad it makes you want to poke your eyes out just to keep you from having to see anymore of it!There was nothing in this movie even remotely close to the Blair Witch movie, so obviously that was just an advertising stunt to try to get attention to a movie that deserves absolutely none.*(Spoilers)*They only spend about 5 minutes of the whole movie "in the woods" so where they came up with that title I have no idea.The "scary monster" thing they came up with is so ridiculous looking, it was actually kinda funny. The fake blood and body parts were so stupid and fake looking, it was almost as if they were trying to make a comedy, but failed miserably.The writing is so horrible, a 5-year old child could come up with a better screenplay and dialogue than the writer of this movie.The acting is also very horrible, very amateur-ish and fake.Do not waste any time or money on this movie, you will live to regret it forever and ever!!!
