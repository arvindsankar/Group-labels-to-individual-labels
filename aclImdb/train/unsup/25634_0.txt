MINOR SPOILERS AHEADThe Plot: Patrick is comatose, his father tries to cure him by giving him the chance to kill using supernatural powers (exactly what one would expect); the victims are invited to a beautiful house in the countryside, Patrick kills some of them - with the major exception of a blonde women, who masturbates in front of him. (which is btw the sole way to survive, in case you see green eyes - big like tennis balls - wobbling in front of you, you know) Patrick vive ancora is a quite uninspired movie. There are several killing scenes, mostly below the giallo standard, the only real climax is the controversial staking (vagina to mouth), which is very explicit and not cut at all (mediablaster/shriek show DVD edition). See this scene, be shocked or amused, call for the censor or the Chinese delivery, and skip the rest of the movie. Except you are the sole fan of supernatural-sado-porn-scifi-giallos.If so - get it at any costs.3 black gloves out of 10.
