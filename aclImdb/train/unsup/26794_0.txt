Terry Moore stars in this tripe about a rich kid who fakes his own kidnapping in order to get attention from Mummy and Daddykins. But Terry Moore remains the only reason to watch. Let's see, what else? There are some cool Mercedes-Benzes..... um..... the palm trees in Beverly Hills are very pretty..... uh..... *zzzzzzz* - oh, sorry!Did I mention Terry Moore?! - yeah, I did. Well, that's about it. Let's review, shall we? The reasons to watch this movie are:1. Terry Moore, 2. cool Mercedes-Benzes, 3. pretty palm treesThere. We're done. That wasn't so bad, was it? A bit of advice, though. If you are planning on watching this, get totally blitzed first. At least then you won't be able to remember it the next day.
