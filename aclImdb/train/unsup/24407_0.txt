I just love these old classics,you can watch them over and over again and never tyre of them.I recently bought this original of ebay,an ex-rental as they have the original trailers etc on them and boy was it money well spent! I have a fantastic collection of these original movies and this is one of my favourites! It has all the horror and gore and tension you could want along with a bit of nudity chucked in for good measure.I'd say this is a must for serious collectors if you can get a copy as this has been deleted in original format since 1993!The story is good and the special effects are above average for the budget the late 80's early 90's horror films usually had!Go get it now and have a great slice of retro horror in your proud collection!10/10
