This is the best of the Kay Francis vehicles, and I had never heard of it before a couple days ago.Kay is stylish, George Brent actually looks handsome. And there is a real plot, not just cutesy and/or tear-jerking posturing.Married couples, formerly married couples. And -- a couple who are jewel thieves.It zings along and is great, amusing, romantic fun.
