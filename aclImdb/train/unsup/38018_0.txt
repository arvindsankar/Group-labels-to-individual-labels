This may contain spoilers.This movie is not as horrible, in my opinion as many before me had stated.The movie itself is a little laggy with some boring parts that are hard to stay tuned to.This movie has flashbacks in a his view / her view type of situation. But who do you believe? A student falls for her married teacher with murder in the end.I personally don't think this is a must watch or even that suspenseful as many things give the ending away about 1/3 of the way through it.If nothing else is on and you find yourself looking for 2 hours to kill on a made for TV movie then give it a chance. It is just OK for me.
