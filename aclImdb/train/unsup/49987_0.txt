Thin plot - even for a teen slasher movie.Where's my free sample of shrooms or any mind inducing drug? I could have used this while watching Shrooms.The blueish hue is supposed to make this much more scarier...it just don't work. It just makes it look bad - real bad.There could have been some humor thrown in to make this a good film...especially since the shrooms were supposed to make you laugh...but no. Just lame action, uninteresting dialog, boring sett.Add to that, the typical screech that all horror movies must have and it just becomes really boring and bland.So much could have been done with this, but so much was left out. I assume that a second or third write was never thought of before filming and that nobody thought to expand on the story a bit.I want my sample damnit!!!! I deserve some good quality drugs after sitting through this.At least everybody got a paycheck out of it - or should have.Kinda shitty ending.
