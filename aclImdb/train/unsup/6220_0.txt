UK does not produce a lot of films, but what it makes, it is wellmade. The photography of this film is stunning, the scenery ofYorkshire Dales is beyond believe, it is like oil painting. All of thescenery shots are well composed, well balanced. Although I must say,they must have waited for years for the lovely weather to turn up, asusually that part of UK is dull and wet, even in summer. The stillphotos of the ladies, although they are not the originals,are veryartistic and well made. The story line is simple, yet moving. Thewhole package is a pleasing moving which I could recommend to anyone.
