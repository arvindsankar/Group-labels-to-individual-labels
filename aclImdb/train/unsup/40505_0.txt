Allow me to ask some rhetorical questions:-Why would ANY airport allow an 11 year-old on a plane WITHOUT CHECKING THEIR TICKET?-Don't you think Megan is a little too smart to get on the wrong plane?-Why would the most PRESTIGIOUS hotel in Los Angeles allow a single 11 year-old to stay in the PRESIDENTIAL SUITE? Without checking her credit card? Do the words FRAUDULENT CHARGES ring a bell?-How was Megan allowed to stay in the hotel's PRESIDENTIAL SUITE, which costs a good $15,000 a night (or more) for over a week? Gee, that's over $100,000, plus ROOM SERVICE. Her mom and dad are going to be ticked...-How did a couple of thugs outwit ARMED GUARDS to get a money printing press? And just to top it all off, it wasn't really a very funny movie...
