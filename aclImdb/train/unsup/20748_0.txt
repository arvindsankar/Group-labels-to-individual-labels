If you are from Columbus you would understand things a little better like Bizzy Bone's beef with the Detroit boys. Columbus Gang members use to war with the Detroit boys. it wasn't nicea great story that could have been true. We thought that it was true story until we ran into the people that made it and they said it wasn't.for the record. the guys thought that house was a suburban house obvious haven't been here in the Ceo. that was the straight hood on the east side. some of the folks there just keep their house up.I could see how some people not from here could miss some parts of the movie
