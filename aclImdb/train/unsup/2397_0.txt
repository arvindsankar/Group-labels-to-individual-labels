I enjoyed the movie - the plot line has some twists and Bruce Willis is as good as ever. The only thing that spoilt the movie for me was the amateur filming - it looks at times as if the cameraman is holding a home movie camera. The swaying to and fro gives you the front row experience even if you are seated near the back.At one stage they are in a Chinese laundry and you find yourself thinking about the drunken cameraman and not the story, to the point where it gets confusing as to what is really happening. My recommendation is to wait for this movie to get to the dollar theaters or else wait until it comes out on DVD.This is not the only movie to suffer from this amateurish filming - what has happened to our standards of film-making? Pay the stars a bit less and the technical crew a bit more.
