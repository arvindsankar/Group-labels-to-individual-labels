I read James Dixon's great novelization of this sequel first, so my expectations were high. Too high. It plays like a retread of the first film with three killer tots instead of one.John Ryan is back trying to warn other parents of the infant scourge, but nobody listens until it's too late or they're dead.Once again, Cohen gives us a dialog-heavy, vapid time-waster with little action until the last ten minutes and badly directed action at that.Bernard Herrmann's score is culled from unused cues from the first film and is the film's only saving grace.If you can still find it, read the novelization and consider what this film could have been.
