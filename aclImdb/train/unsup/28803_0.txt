It's a good screwball comedy, but the subject is too sensitive a theme in this age. A movie which has a man dating, albeit reluctantly, a teenager just wouldn't go in today's world.I was a teenager when this came out and that's not really the way we were either. However, we were used to Hollywood's portrayal of us and just shrugged our shoulders.Be that as it may, this is a good comedy, somewhat routine but well done and especially well written. Somehow Myrna Loy didn't seem quite right with Cary Grant as she did with William Powell, but that's okay.The comedy was somewhat sporadic, but the picnic scene is especially hilarious. All in all, a worthwhile movie for those who enjoy screwball comedy.
