This movie is practically my all time favorite. At least favorite comedy. It is absolutely brilliant, with lovely actors hilarious script, everything really.Jez (Stuart Townsend) is very cute and just incredible. Georgie (Kate Beckinsale) is almost like I would have wanted to be if I could choose.I love this movie so much, and I laughed just as much when I'd seen it three times as after the first.
