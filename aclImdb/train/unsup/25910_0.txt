This show premiered last night on tbs and at first i thought it was just gonna be a new show with no point. Boy was i wrong.10 Items or Less is a funny and smart show with lots of potential.The acting is also great and funny.The actors they picked are great at there job.I have only seen one episode so i don't no all that much about the show but from what I've seen, it will be great! I hope this show's not cancelled cause from what I've seen, ill probably be watching this show a lot.For everybody out there that likes this show, you ROCK!
