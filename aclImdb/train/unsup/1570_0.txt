Interesting that when this show was made, it was two years before the Supreme Court Ruling June, 1963 Madyln Murray vs. whichever school district that eliminated prayer in public schools.(This is NOT intended to be an argument for or against the ruling).The United States has moved toward what this story is all about in the last 40 years.George Orwell would have loved Rod Serling.Watching this gave me the willies. How much has changed and it makes me wonder if the United States will move toward what Serling predicted.I think it will.
