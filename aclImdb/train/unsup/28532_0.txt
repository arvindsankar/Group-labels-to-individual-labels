The Plot: Clive Owen ( before he was in "The Bourne Identity," "King Arthur," "Elisabeth: The Golden Age," and "Sin CIty" ) plays a "hire" who drives people places they desperately need to go. Often times, they are working for something "top secret" and can only give our protagonist limited information. Also, this is meant to show off the BMW car and is executive-produced by Tony Scott, Ridley Scott and David Fincher ( Panic Room, Alien 3 ).Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ( BABEL, 21 Grams ), this intense tale follows our hero in a foreign country torn by terrorist attacks trying to get a photographer (played by the excellent Stellan Skarsgard ) out of there and keep his photos unharmed.
