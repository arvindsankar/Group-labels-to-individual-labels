As a man who LOVES the inept film Children of the Living Dead, I was stunned by just how horrid this 'film' is. This videotape can only possibly be enjoyed by the cast of retarded amateurs whose names populate the credits. Nothing Troma has done has EVER been this worthless. Never purchase, rent, or even download this videotape.I must fill out a few more lines to submit this, and with the videotape still in mind I now submit these lines: nose breathing is not funny.not editing out the director's voice is not funny.whacky hair is not funny.everything in this videotape that people spent time on is not funny
