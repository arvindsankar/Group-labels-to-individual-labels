I would change places with the three gorgeous guys (Angus, Ben and Corey) in no special order just to kiss them. I am sure that a woody would occur. A snow ball in hell would have a better chance than I would at my age.Although this film was made in the early 90's anyone would find it a great movie. Oh come on! All movies have flaws. Try making a perfect movie on a limited budget and limited distribution.The title is a little misleading but the book explains it yet not detailed enough.Purchase it! You will not be disappointed.
