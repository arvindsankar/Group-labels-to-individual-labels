I am so disgusted that this kind of low-grade film would even be in stores to rent in the first place.They should have a warning label on the cover: Warning, may cause you to want to poke your eyes out just to keep from having to see anymore of it!!What a total piece of crap. The acting has got to be the worst part about this, although everything about it is very ameteur-ish, and stupid.The dialogue all seemed to be made up on the spot. They obviously didn't even have a writer or a screenplay (or a director?), they just filmed a bunch of stupid scenes that don't even make sense and decided to put them together.Try getting some actors that actually have talent and a script that wasn't made up on the spot, or better yet-- do everyone a favor and go back to your day job.You must be a total fool to actually sit through this movie in it's entirety.AVOID AT ALL COSTS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
