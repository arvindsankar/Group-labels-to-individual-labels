These people are so naive to believe that corporations are evil and that nationalizing everything is good.in North Korea, USSR, the Warsaw pact and China, everything was state property, were they utopias? Not by a longshot. In fact, the most deaths in the 20th century were caused by communism and the worst famines were in communist countries alongside the killing fields in Cambodia, persecution of the religious, the gulags among other things.As for the makers of the documentary. i would leave them a choice: where would you want to live? North Korea (communist, no corporations) or South Korea(corporations, freedoms etc.)?
