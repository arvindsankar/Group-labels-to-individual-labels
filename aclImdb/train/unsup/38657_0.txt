Seriously, every reviewer on IMDb has crud for brains. It's a complete piece of bile tripe.The entire thing is shot in black and white, the acting is supremely sub-par, the camera work is crap. Forgivable in 99% of the indie films out there that are carried by a story. Or even engaging dialog. This movie has *NONE* of it.The vignettes are standalone (although the bit with the RZA, GZA and Bill Murray was referential), pointless and trying too hard to capture absurdist humor.The use of Black and White does not provide deep arty scenes, or work as an illustrative device. The only reason to opt for black & white is so that Art House snobs will accept it as "brilliant".I am a fan of deadpan absurdist comedy, I really am. In fact one of the biggest selling points was Steven Wright.This is not a comedy. There are half-hearted attempts (Chick who is looking at handguns, Bill Murray "hiding out" drinking a pot of coffee straight, etc), but it falls short. Waaaaaay Short.Look, I revel in "bad" films. I forced a friend to go and see "Slither" in the theaters. I have a collection of zombie movies that, if moved to a physical medium, would crush a small child. I enjoy the likes of Kafka, HS Thompson, the Vandals, Monty Python, Firesign Theater, Hedberg, etc et al.This movie is a failure, epic and tragic.
