some good gory scenes, otherwise the continuity, and other factors concerning the production sux.the actors are kinda bad...the plot if there is one is not that great =D it reminded me of a porn flick =D if there were no gore, this movie would not be watchable.i little boring i guess...i was reading a book, while watching this one... and i watched just the parts with the gore.this movie is definitely not a winner, but i've seen worse, unless you have really nothing else to do, then you can watch.oh lord the radio part is real crappy =D
