The only thing that puts this movie above "manos" is that there are no 20-minute long shots of panning roadside. nowhere will you find more vapid, meaningless, heavy handed tripe than you will in the doom generation.spoiler alert:this movie was so bad, that i did not feel sorry for the protagonist when he was anally raped while having his penis cut off with pruning shears by a band of shirtless neo-nazis while his girlfriend and best friend were wrapped in plastic and beaten.It is worthwhile to read the back of the box, that is worth a laugh, as it seems to have been written by a major stoner.3000 Dinars to the man who brings me greg akari's head on a pike.
