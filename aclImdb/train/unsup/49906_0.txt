Fay Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro are the only real reasons to watch this movie. Those two women steal the show. Helen Slater as Supergirl was an okay choice, but it was her first film. She's come a long way (acting wise) since then. Still, it isn't her fault. The story is trite and the action sequences are muddled with silly attempts at comedy. The romance subplot was mind-numbingly ridiculous. Even Jimmy Olsen from the Superman films (Marc McClure) had a few schmaltzy scenes. This is so-not a good movie. Enough said...
