If, as promised, this movie was restored then the results are simply horrible.A company called National Film Museum gave this film to another company called Hypercube IIc, in New York to digitally restore the film.But, instead of a intelligent restoration what this people did was to tint every scene to red, probably with Photoshop, with disastrous results.Douglas M. Protsik music is as unremarkable as the bad restoration. His accompaniment does not enhance the images at all.In all, the available print shown on TCM is unwatchable and I had to turn off the TV set.
