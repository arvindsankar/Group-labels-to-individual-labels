The messages were many: cooperation, perseverance, strength in the face of adversity and to not fear new ideas.This is supposed to be a movie for children; but some of it is pretty brutal: I would not take small children in spite of its `G' rating.The story is sweet and simple; allowing more time for the messages and character development. I found myself actually caring for these hideous creatures and cringed when one of them was injured.Max Casella, who seems to be eternally cast as some kind of geek on television and movies again plays a geek -- only this time a primate.Della Reese's voice is instantaneously recognizable as Â‘Eema' the old, caring, mother figure. Kind of the `Mother of All Dinosaurs.' She does it well.The many outstanding locations used as backgrounds were magnificent. You will recognize the waterfall from `Jurassic Park' immediately.The CGI was done very well -- but not (sadly) as well as `Stuart Little'.The score (apparently by James Newton Howard) is absolutely outstanding: majestic, serious and haunting in all the appropriate moments.I am pleased to say that this was a much better film than I was expecting -- I enjoyed it completely.
