This was one of the best shows of its kind when it was running.A classic 1980's situation comedy. I cant believe it ran for that many episodes. I also cant believe that it finished that long ago.Michael J Fox really made the show, and the show was based on him, and the family he was a member of.Or though the episodes were only 30 minutes long, the comedy it provided was excellent.I hope the series can come out on DVD very soon.This series deserves to be seen by future generations.
