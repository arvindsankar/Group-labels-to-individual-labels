FIrst things first I had no idea that this was a PG-13 rated movie, I saw the first few minutes of this movie on TV and decided to rent the movie on the basis of the hilarious scene about the campaign posters.Surely a movie with words such as Bitch and Whore would have a R-rating and would mean much more bolder jokes and hot maybe nude women right.But I had underestimated the absurdity of the American Rating system and I ended up seeing a movie with a PG-13 rating, a rating that I always try and avoid.Anyway i scaled down my expectations accordingly and sat back and enjoyed the ride.Luckily the movie dwelled on stereotypes that despite what people say lead to some of the funniest jokes, seeing black, Asian, white and political stereotypes is going to funny on screen no matter what you say.The jokes were hilarious throughout and despite the fact that I seriously thought they would become stale after a while there was always some wacky, juvenile joke around the corner to get me laughing again.The movie has some hilarious scenes such as the Kidnap Scene, the store robbery scene, the shout out etc. In fact when you think about it even though you may fall out of your seat laughing in any scene (they normally require buildups which are rare in modern comedies) you are either laughing or smiling in this film.The humour in this movie is immature,stereotypical, and slapstick and if you like your comedy subtle and intelligent than please save yourself the effort of watching this movie and dissing it after-wards.This movie does try to be something more towards the end but then which comedy doesn't.The acting is superb especially from the main 3 characters, with James Kennedy obviously stealing the show as the hilarious "Wigger", but take nothing away from Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson who did a splendid job as theatre actors who get nothing but roles as black stereotypes. The rest of the cast were playing those said stereotypes and didn't display any special talent except Kal Penn who was hilarious.Direction and other technical aspects are not important and not worth mentioning.The chicks are ugly and the garish display of man-abs on some of the women really put me off.There are no hot girls in this movie.The soundtrack is OK and adds the the feel of the movie.The few bad things are :- 1)That there are stretches that evoke nothing more than a chuckle and you crave for a distraction like some hot girls or a buildup to a big scene that is not there.2)PG-13 means that a bunch of jokes lose their impact for fear of treading on racist jokes territory and lead to more smiles and less laughs.3)People with the wrong company or with larger attention spans will eventually Overdose on the jokes and cease to find the movie funny after a while.These point especially the last one may have a serious bearing on how you feel when the movie ends.Please don't take this movie seriously it comes from a heritage of stand-up.All in all a good movie thats good for a bunch of laughs with like minded friends.Those who like intelligent subtle humour should avoid.-s no hot chicks, long stretches of chuckles,PG-13, high chance of Overdose.+/-s stereotypes (i love them)\, lots of chuckles.+s superb acting, lots of genuinely funny scenes, fresh film.total 7/10 (factoring in lowered expectations if you split his movie in clips it would make 3 great episodes of a comedy program clearly showing its stand-up heritage the whole package has a lesser impact though).
