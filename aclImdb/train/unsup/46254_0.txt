...as one of those films you go to see, knowing nothing about it, except that you like the stars: i.e., Jeff Goldblum and Michelle Pfeiffer.I was also wanting to get together with a friend I hadn't seen in a while.Does the fault lie in my expectations or in the impression that the ads led me to believe the film would be about.If it is a spoiler to expect to see a madcap comedy with two actors who are really good at madcap comedy, and get a very bleak, Brechtian story, then I am guilty.
