Standard, typical tear-jerker - highly-renowned concerto artist deserts family to take off with his child's piano teacher. They cavort around Europe until she finally throws him out and resumes her music career.The ladies in the audience use up three handkerchiefs apiece with their weeping. The men wonder at the idiot male who gives up the luscious Bergman to return to sleep with his wife who is stupid enough to take him back.The plot is straight out of East Lynne and told dozens of times on stage and in screen. Two star-crossed lovers finally come to their senses when they are reminded about the lives they are ruining with their carrying-ons. So they cry on each others shoulders and go their separate ways. A stinker of a movie.
