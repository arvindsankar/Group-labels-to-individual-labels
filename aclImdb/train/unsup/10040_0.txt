It looks like this movie has had quite mixed reviews, but personallyI love it! It's outrageous, irreverent and absolutely hilarious. Thespecial effects are amazing and the gags just keep coming.There are so many witty lines that it's hard to remember them all.One of my favourites is when Bruce Willis and Goldie Hawn planto murder Meryl Streep (who plays Willis' wife). They concoct anelaborate plot to push her car off Mulholland Drive, but Willis endsup pushing her down the stairs instead. After the deed is done hephones Goldie Hawn and breathlessly exclaims, "Helen? I did it!She's dead, she started shouting at me and I couldn't take it anymore and I pushed her down the stairs and she's dead!" There isa long pause on the other end of the phone, then Hawn slowlyasks , ". . . which part of the plan didn't you understand?".Meanwhile, Streep is not dead, but is slowly standing up at the footof the stairs with her head on backwards!Isabella Rosselini is good as the mysterious Lisle von Rhumanand, at times, looks and sounds uncannily like her mother, IngridBergman. The film is not everyone's cup of tea, I know, but it's a scream!
