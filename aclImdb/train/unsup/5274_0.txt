This wicked satire of imperialistic Germany during reign of Wilhem 11 was made in East Germany.It is from a Heinrich Mann novel, Written by Fritz Staudte and directed by Wolfgang Staudte,These last 2 gentleman gave us, a few years prior the heavy dramas, ROTATION and MURDERERS ARE Among US.This 1951 movie is a pleasant change of pace.The pace is fast & furious as all satires are supposed to be. There are a few songs at the beginning,I think I would have liked a few more.The acting by all is first rate & all production values are equally good.Ratings: *** (out of4 )82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
