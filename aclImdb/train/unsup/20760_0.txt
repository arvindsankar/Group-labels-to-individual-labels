I'd heard from a friend that he was offended, but I didn't think this poorly shot movie was worth getting worked up about. A went with a small group of friends, (both gay and straight) and we left before it ended. As for being provocative, well, I thought it was pretty ho hum.It seems as though the writers thought that anything showing gays would stir up interest.I think the IDEA behind it had promise,but maybe with more experienced crew,it might have gone somewhere. The narrator had a great voice, though.
