Badly written, slow sci-fi animation story. Characters are cardboard which perhaps fits the puppet like animation. Miserable pacing of the story.Action sequences are not edited well and are difficult to follow. Background animation is miserable and often out of focus. Obviously this is a low budget attempt.The dialogue is ludicrous. They all seem to talk like Yoda from Star Wars? Why?There are good ideas here; just poorly executed.Don't waste your time. Not even worth a rental.
