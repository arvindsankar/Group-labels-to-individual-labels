Normally I don't like to bash indie cinema (It's more fun to trash movies that are poorly crafted but cost $$$ to make) but I have to make an exception. I was fooled by the high IMDb rating and reviews on this turkey, which must havebeen posted by friends of the creator. Let me say upfront that I'm far fromreligious, and appreciate good satire in the vein of Election. This was too dumb to be called satire. A Jesus with a whiny Brookyln accent shows up nude in NYC (a'la "The Terminator") and crafts a spandex powder blue "superhero costume" to relate to today's youth. Lots of scatology and sex jokes as Jesus turns thecommandments to pro casual sex to win converts. The video and especiallyaudio are sub-porno quality. "Jesus" fights Richard Nixon (guy in rubber Nixon mask) Jim Morrison and Dracula. An interesting concept badly executed. Lookelsewhere for religious humor not so puerile, I suggest "The Life of Brian".
