This is so awful that it's offensive to movies that are just plain awful.The acting is garbage, the story is garbage, the filming is garbage.It's just a bunch of kids (whom many seem to old for the parts) that talk about their and other peoples genitals, and commits acts of violence for no apparent reason.Also the bad guy (as if the "kids" weren't dislikable enough) is a disgusting old bald man who likes to dress in leather and works as both a butcher and as a amateur porn film-maker.If you have had the accident to buy this movie, find the closest dumpster and dump it down quick.Yes, you could of course sell it to some poor soul who hasn't read this review BUT do you really want that on your conscience?
