I couldn't believe my professor assigned this movie for a class. Ugh.The production values are not too great, and the score is AWFUL!In general, it feels like a corny 80s sex fantasy drawn out for 90 minutes.But without a lot of sex.Some of the nature scenes are very pretty, and it's almost in the so-bad-it's-fun category.But not quite.Definitely not recommended, unless you're having a bad-obscure-80s movie film fest.And maybe not even then.
