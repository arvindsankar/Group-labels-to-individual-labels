What a total surprise. One sunny Afternoon, my associate and I wander into a dark little cinema in Cannes to see a little pubicised film.From the moment the the turquoise beads on the bead curtain parted, and the rich tones of a Brazilian voice, spoke, we were mesmerised.An incredible mix of doom, dispair and triumph in abject failure and disaster.MUST BE SEEN!!!
