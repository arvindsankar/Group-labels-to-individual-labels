An erotic love story.Big Joe used his usual plot devices here.Prostitution ring disguised as a modeling agency services wealthy clients of all types. I couldn't tell if this was filmed in the U.S. or Europe. But wherever it was filmed, it looked great.Seeing Mark Shannon play a cowboy was actually funny. But do cowboys really call every woman they meet 'filly?' Laura (Goddess Supreme) Gemser matures in her roles and actually plays the boss of women instead of just a rebel. I hated the fact that she cut her hair. She looked better with it loooooooong. She's still a Goddess however.The sub-plot about the young lad dealing with potential homosexuality was a tad weird.But the lass in the lead looked GREAT. Her massage scene with the Turk left me gasping.
