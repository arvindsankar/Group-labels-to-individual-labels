I will keep this short as I am sure there have been heaps of comments so I will break into things I did and didn't like about the film.Things I likedIt was good to see some full Jedi in action not just a half trained Luke SkywalkerDarth Maul was cool but criminally underusedThe light sabre duel at the end was awsome, however I do have a problem about the two Jedi ganging up on Maul it does not seem very nobleThe planet effects were breath takingThings I didn,t likeWooden actors no emotion at allPoor storySpecial effects should be reserved for planet shots and space shots.They simply do not work on characters.Jar Jar and co looked like cartoon characters with no depth or weight to them at all.Jar Jar Binks, say no more he sucks big timeI also discovered having read many comments from others on this page that many who liked this film were very offensive to those who did not,saying that they were not true Star Wars fans or did not get it. I am a long time Star Wars fan but I am not willing to say that anything George Lucas cranks out is the best thing since sliced bread. To wrap up on the whole most people liked the first three films, but with this one a great deal did, a great deal didn't, and some were indifferent and that I thinks tells the whole story.
