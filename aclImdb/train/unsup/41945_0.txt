This film was so derivative, the only pleasure we got watching it was trying to identify which movie a particular scene was most directly stolen from. The result is a formless mishmash with no character of its own.At every turn, there was something that didn't make sense - such as the two main characters entering and wandering around freely in an insane asylum (which was itself as clich√©d as anything in the movie.) What, no security, no locked doors to keep the inmates in or intruders out?Rating: skip this one.
