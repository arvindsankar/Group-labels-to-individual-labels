Cursed be you, Burt Reynolds.Because of "Smokey and the Bandit", the movie-going public has been forced to slog through millions of pale imitations of the same product, all to make a buck.Which brings us to "Smokey Bites the Dust"; which, I think, DID earn at least a buck.Meaning it broke even with its budget.From the beginning scene where we see the Smokey of the title drinking from a baby bottle with booze in it while waiting for speeders in Backwater, USA, I knew I was in for a slow downhill ride to nowhere. I was right.If one county, let alone backwoods town actually had this many car crashes in the course of one day, they could very well become the scrap metal center of the known world. As it turns out, this entire movie IS the scrap (minus the "s") center of the known world all by itself.Gale Ann Hurd produced this when she was young and foolish. We all gotta start somewhere, I suppose.One star. Plus half a star for the dumb jock football player.
