...because I wanted to watch this movie when it came out in theaters. Then I didn't rent it at Blockbuster for reasons I can't remember.I watched it when it aired on HBO. And man, what a letdown.The gorgeous Anne Hathaway was the main reason for me to watch this pile of crap. She doesn't save the day. Kate Hudson does her job but it isn't enough.There isn't a single funny moment. This shouldn't be considered as a comedy or drama, or anything.It's a dull, silly, pointless movie that doesn't delivers a single positive message for it's audience.The sexy Anne Hathaway at least shows some skin during her dancing sequences and I thank her for that. The humor is bland and you won't even smile. What was the intention of this movie? The ending that deals with the pregnancy was an insult for cinema.
