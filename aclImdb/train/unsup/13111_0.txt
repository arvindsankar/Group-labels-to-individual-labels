Interesting film and a total change of pace for Errol Flynn, playing an erudite gentleman who is as nasty as can be. He literally forces Greer Garson into a loveless marriage and of course she looks to be loved.For a change, her usual movie partner, Walter Pidgeon, takes on a supporting role and is totally subordinate to Garson all together. It is interesting how they find love together.Another interesting casting move here is Robert Young, the suitor of Janet Leigh, niece of Garson and Flynn. You would never suspect that Garson could find love with Young but they do until tragedy intervenes.This is still basically a story of Victorian England with an upper middle class family's snobbishness along with their traditional folkways and mores.
