The Life and Times of Tim features just that; the day-to-day life of an ordinary 25 year old New Yorker, trying to talk his way out of horribly embarrassing situations. Tim really has the worst luck, and his dry, dead-pan excuses are the centre piece of this show.I urge you to watch just one story (there are two per episode) as you'll be hooked. The writing is very good. It's a little surreal how things could go so badly but it lends to hilarious situations and dialogue.Give it a chance, like Arrested Development, it won't be appreciated en masse during it's run.With so many animations that are faltering in great humour (I rarely laugh out loud the Simpsons, Family Guy or American Dad any more - South Park still does the business from time to time) This show had me laughing really hard a few times per episode.I've gotten everyone I've shown "Tim" to into the show, which is actually saying a lot. I really hope it gets a second season at least.Enjoy watching!
