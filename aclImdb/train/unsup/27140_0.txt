Esily, the worst of the Ernest line, but there are still lessons to be learned, and enjoyment to be had.This should have been entitled, "Ernest and the Magick Shoes," however, Slam Dunk will have to suffice.Ernest AKA Jim Varney, brings his usual charm and great redneck style to this work, in spite of the work's detriment of bearing ghetto-branded plot line, movie props, and message.But beneath all that, there is another message...one you're familiar with if you read my reviews regularly: Hold Onto Your Dreams.Ernest is a likable little fella, whose life is a noir work, and whose physical appearance is reminiscent of a living-breathing cartoon character. He enjoyed a rather large following while he was alive, and many still love him and his works.This is the worst of the run, and as such, rates a 3.4/10 from...the Fiend :.
