This is the English 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas' in one laughable film. It is very well known how much the English want to be Americans and this movie proves it.Like in 'Lock Stock...' and 'Snatch', they try to create a New York environment in London, which is not realistic. They want it so much to make these gangsters be like their Italian-American counterparts and the end result is completely ridiculous. 'Buy yourself a nice suit...', yeah, right.Apart from that, Paul Bettany can hardly act and the director is the perfect Scorcese wanna-be.Malcolm McDowell is (as always) great though...2/10
