This is movie is extremely average with nothing much in it. It's trying to use the success of Death Note to try to sell itself. I had already read and heard reviews for this movie being horrible. So I had very very very low expectations in this one. But the problem is when you see L , you really start expecting something smart, something intelligent. And you get highly disappointed :-( If they had made this movie without the Death Note characters , it would have be a bad movie. But using the same characters is even worse, as you tend to expect them to do their regular bit. Believe me, when you see L on the screen, you will start thinking that he is upto something, or he will come out with something smart and surprising. But no .. nothing like that at all. That is the reason why I gave it a 4. Unlike the earlier Death Notes : * there is hardly a plot * no brilliant moment at all in the movie* it goes a little sentimental at times * lines of L are very often useless * there is no Ryuk * there is no Light Yagami * emotional side of L is seen as he gets along with 2 childrenIn fact, I am going to stop talking about this movie at all. I'd like to mention at this point , that Death Note 1 and 2 were simply awesome !!!
