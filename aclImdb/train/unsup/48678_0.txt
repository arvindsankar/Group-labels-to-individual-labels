This film is so utterly horrible that it defies description.Leslie Neilson does a great stony-faced captain, Patrick Macnee is almost good as a mad scientist (as the box claims him to be). In fact, the actors all actually do a fairly good job.So what is wrong with this piece of garbage?I guess it boils down to the script. The concept of a couple of musical numbers is cute, but they don't work. The special effects don't work. The fact that you can see the concrete floor of the studio doesn't work. The space ship models are so reprehensibly bad that they don't work.The movie just doesn't work.I remember the first time I saw the box for this DVD at Best Buy. They wanted $20. I read the box, saw the cast, and a cold shiver clutched my bowels. I _knew_ this was a horrible film.But time passed, and I came upon a copy for $5 at a used book store and I should have passed on it. Instead I wasted 90 minutes of my life and whatever time it's taking me to write this warning, sorry, review.I'll end with this: at the end of the credits you find out it was made in 1983 at a community college.It shows.
