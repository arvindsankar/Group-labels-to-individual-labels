There's a great drinking game hidden in this movie. All of the scenes, plots, characters, settings, dialog seem to be lifted from other movies. Sadly, this movie would be better if they just cut and pasted all the clips from each movie together, rather than reshooting them. But I think if you recognize something ripped off from another movie, you should get to drink.ie. Star Wars: film opens with alien space ship passing before camera The Abyss: incidental appearance of nuclear attack submarine unfriendly commando(s) underwater research station aliens at the bottom of the ocean Operatic music when aliens appear husband and wife together in underwater base Deep Blue Sea: smart sharks that are team players Jaws: the beach scene, including water-level camera angle Jaws2: aircraft gets attacked by shark Alien: blue collar crewmen, sassing the female boss Aliens Pvt Hudson & the unwilling tech guy ("Game over man", vs. "I'm not going out there") The Black Hole cowardly dude gets what's coming after stealing the escape podLeviathan: sunken cargo ship with dangerous cargo symbolical breaking to helpless support shipand lots, lots more. I'll stop here, because my BAC is approaching critical.Favorite bits: the seaplane approaching the base, yet with the shore only a few hundred yards away. Our heroes, who swim faster than a nuclear sub, and faster than the sound of the explosion which would have otherwise concussed them. Fearless leader, who suspects the health inspector is from the CIA, which is obviously your first choice when thinking about groups of really mean guys Sub Captain, who lets any old health inspector aboard his nuclear attack vessel, without making that phone call to check up on them, first.
