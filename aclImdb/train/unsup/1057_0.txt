I seem to be in the minority here. I can't understand why thismovie isn't getting the most enthusiastic reviews.Sure, the plot has been visited again and again in books, moviesand TV (including Richard Basehart's mind being taken over atleast 34 times in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea). Does thatmatter so much? Haven't we seen "Saving Private Ryan" and "A.I."before? Did anyone criticize them as "just another Longest Day,"or "just another 'robot wants to be human'" movies?The Puppet Masters is expertly handled. The direction is tight andsuspense-building. The early scenes of the kids with the UFOroadside attraction are clever. Sutherland is great. The dialogueis realistic. This remains one of my favorites
