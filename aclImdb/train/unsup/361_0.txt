This man (mr. Schuch) is definitely out of character - ALL the time!He is well known in his hometown, The same town of Orson Wells, Don Ameche and more His humour is almost legendary as well as his compassion. And ACT, he can do this out brown paper bag. In costume he changes and then he changes back.But it seems that every time we see he is going to have that one chance - then snap- there goes the cutting room floor.I pray someday Christopher Guest sees him and make a movie just for him. For those of you unfamiliar - you are on IMDb - they have it allHe is just like Mr. Guest in every way.
