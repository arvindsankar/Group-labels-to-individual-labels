I saw this recently after seeing Terrance Davies lovely The HouseOf Mirth, and was not disappointed. Actually, they make a nice littleEdith Wharton weekend, if you have a lot of time on your handsand want to feel so good about your own life and choices that youwant to shoot yourself. And I mean that in a good way. This movieis beautifully crafted, and features Winona Ryders bestperformance since Little Women. Daniel Day Lewis has thethankless Edith Wharton male lead role- she wrote best forwomen- and Michelle Pfeiffer is that obscure object of desire. Thisfilm doesn't have the bite and bile that most Scorsese films have,but it's well worth the trip.
