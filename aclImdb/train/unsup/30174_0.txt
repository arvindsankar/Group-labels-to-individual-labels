I love short story films, especially when, of one particular theme, they are connected to satisfy a feature length running time.Like taking any subway/underground/metro train, with Subway Stories, if you don't like one particular story, wait a few minutes and a better one will come along.Of course everyone will have their particular favourites, but for meFern's Heart of Darkness, Sax Cantor Riff, Manhattan Miracle, Love on the A Train, and Underground were simply original and wonderful.I'm English and lived in London for four years so these types of stories are not exclusive to New York. Where there are people, there are possibilities.
