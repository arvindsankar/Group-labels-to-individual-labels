I love a lot of Yuzna stuff like "Society", "The Dentist", his finalepisode in "Necronomicon" was easily the best in the movie, "Progeny" wasn't bad and "Return of the living dead 3" had somegood outrageous moments, but this movie...really... it is justastoundingly bad! It's so bad it's almost embarrassing to watch. The acting isterrible,it's sad to see Jeffrey "Re-Animator" Combs in this mess,but probably he couldn't say no to an old pal Like Brian Yuzna.The effects, especially the digital bits, are laughable too. Thecostumes are rubber costumes that seem to come from a shopthat sells cheap Halloween outfits! And worst of all, there is noatmosphere whatsoever. Knowing his previous work I really don'tknow what to say...it seems as if Yuzna has directed thisblindfolded. I know the man has intelligence and a sharp sense ofhumor (in his grotesque but enjoyable over the top way), but itseems he's lost them completely on this one. Avoid at all costs Vote 2/10
