I'm at a total loss when I read the other reviews about this movie. I'm seriously wondering if we all watched the same movie.Now, what in particular was the points which dragged the movie down?1) The tempo was god-awful slow. 2) The plot was as original as the 174:th western flick in late 1979. 3) The acting was horrible with the exception of Ben Cross which was the only real actor in this debacle. 4) Dolph had as many (and well thought out) lines in this flick as he did as Drago in Rocky IV. 5) The budget was almost non-existent which means that this film did not even have the normal cushion to fall back on like it's fellow titles in the trash bin, a $50 million effects and props budget. In short, the director of this movie seem to have aspired to reach the grandeur of an Uwe Boll production. Really says it all, doesn't it?
