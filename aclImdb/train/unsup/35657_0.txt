You know how after eating at a Chinese buffet, no matter how much you eat you never get full? That's how I felt after watching this movie. There should have been more.Don't get me wrong, I don't want the movie to be longer - I want more jokes. This was a comedy, right? I think jokes are an important part of comedy.I have seen episodes of Lost with more comedic relief than this movie.I've seen Youtube videos that were better than this.It's hard to believe that such a talented writer as Harold Ramis of Caddyshack and National Lampoon's Vacation could have hatched this bad egg out of his mindgrapes.This would have been a great movie in Fantasyland.
