I thought it was a jaded and predictable film. Predictable in that the two stories using the same script...one in a totalitarian dictatorship and one in the US are not the same.Would a film with the same script telling two different stories about a woman who murdered a man who killed her child and one about a man who murdered a female doctor who performed abortions and "killed his child" be as well received however well constructed and "thought provoking" the concept and the film might be? I think not.Since when do we, as Americans, always have to "see the point of view" of those trying to do us harm? It is political correctness taken to the most irrational yet predictable extreme.Why is it thought provoking to make people question whether terrorists are wrong. Perhaps in the coffee shop crowd, but for me, this was just another example of how off kilter we have become.
